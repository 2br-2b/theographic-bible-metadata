            "dictText": "The eldest son of Amram and Jochebed, a daughter of Levi ([Ex. 6:20](/exod#Exod.6.20)). Some explain the name as meaning mountaineer, others mountain of strength, illuminator. He was born in Egypt three years before his brother Moses, and a number of years after his sister Miriam (2:1, 4; 7:7). He married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab of the house of Judah (6:23; [1 Chr. 2:10](/1chr#1Chr.2.10)), by whom he had four sons, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. When the time for the deliverance of Isarael out of Egypt drew nigh, he was sent by God ([Ex. 4:14](/exod#Exod.4.14), [27-30](/exod#Exod.4.27)) to meet his long-absent brother, that he might co-operate with him in all that they were required to do in bringing about the Exodus. He was to be the \u201cmouth\u201d or \u201cprophet\u201d of Moses, i.e., was to speak for him, because he was a man of a ready utterance (7:1, 2, 9, 10, 19). He was faithful to his trust, and stood by Moses in all his interviews with Pharaoh.\n\n When the ransomed tribes fought their first battle with Amalek in Rephidim, Moses stood on a hill overlooking the scene of the conflict with the rod of God in his outstretched hand. On this occasion he was attended by Aaron and Hur, his sister\u2019s husband, who held up his wearied hands till Joshua and the chosen warriors of Israel gained the victory (17:8-13).\n\n Afterwards, when encamped before Sinai, and when Moses at the command of God ascended the mount to receive the tables of the law, Aaron and his two sons, Nadab and Abihu, along with seventy of the elders of Israel, were permitted to accompany him part of the way, and to behold afar off the manifestation of the glory of Israel\u2019s God ([Ex. 19:24](/exod#Exod.19.24); [24:9-11](/exod#Exod.24.9)). While Moses remained on the mountain with God, Aaron returned unto the people; and yielding through fear, or ignorance, or instability of character, to their clamour, made unto them a golden calf, and set it up as an object of worship ([Ex. 32:4](/exod#Exod.32.4); [Ps. 106:19](/ps#Ps.106.19)). On the return of Moses to the camp, Aaron was sternly rebuked by him for the part he had acted in this matter; but he interceded for him before God, who forgave his sin ([Deut. 9:20](/deut#Deut.9.20)).\n\n On the mount, Moses received instructions regarding the system of worship which was to be set up among the people; and in accordance therewith Aaron and his sons were consecrated to the priest\u2019s office ([Lev. 8](/lev#Lev.8); [9](/lev#Lev.9)). Aaron, as high priest, held henceforth the prominent place appertaining to that office.\n\n When Israel had reached Hazeroth, in \u201cthe wilderness of Paran,\u201d Aaron joined with his sister Miriam in murmuring against Moses, \u201cbecause of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married,\u201d probably after the death of Zipporah. But the Lord vindicated his servant Moses, and punished Miriam with leprosy ([Num. 12](/num#Num.12)). Aaron acknowledged his own and his sister\u2019s guilt, and at the intercession of Moses they were forgiven.\n\n Twenty years after this, when the children of Israel were encamped in the wilderness of Paran, Korah, Dathan, and Abiram conspired against Aaron and his sons; but a fearful judgment from God fell upon them, and they were destroyed, and the next day thousands of the people also perished by a fierce pestilence, the ravages of which were only stayed by the interposition of Aaron ([Num. 16](/num#Num.16)). That there might be further evidence of the divine appointment of Aaron to the priestly office, the chiefs of the tribes were each required to bring to Moses a rod bearing on it the name of his tribe. And these, along with the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi, were laid up overnight in the tabernacle, and in the morning it was found that while the other rods remained unchanged, that of Aaron \u201cfor the house of Levi\u201d budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds ([Num. 17:1-10](/num#Num.17.1)). This rod was afterwards preserved in the tabernacle ([Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)) as a memorial of the divine attestation of his appointment to the priesthood.\n\n Aaron was implicated in the sin of his brother at Meribah ([Num. 20:8-13](/num#Num.20.8)), and on that account was not permitted to enter the Promised Land. When the tribes arrived at Mount Hor, \u201cin the edge of the land of Edom,\u201d at the command of God Moses led Aaron and his son Eleazar to the top of that mountain, in the sight of all the people. There he stripped Aaron of his priestly vestments, and put them upon Eleazar; and there Aaron died on the top of the mount, being 123 years old ([Num. 20:23-29](/num#Num.20.23). Comp. [Deut. 10:6](/deut#Deut.10.6); [32:50](/deut#Deut.32.50)), and was \u201cgathered unto his people.\u201d The people, \u201ceven all the house of Israel,\u201d mourned for him thirty days. Of Aaron\u2019s sons two survived him, Eleazar, whose family held the high-priesthood till the time of Eli; and Ithamar, in whose family, beginning with Eli, the high-priesthood was held till the time of Solomon. Aaron\u2019s other two sons had been struck dead ([Lev. 10:1](/lev#Lev.10.1), [2](/lev#Lev.10.2)) for the daring impiety of offering \u201cstrange fire\u201d on the alter of incense.\n\n The Arabs still show with veneration the traditionary site of Aaron\u2019s grave on one of the two summits of Mount Hor, which is marked by a Mohammedan chapel. His name is mentioned in the Koran, and there are found in the writings of the rabbins many fabulous stories regarding him.\n\n He was the first anointed priest. His descendants, \u201cthe house of Aaron,\u201d constituted the priesthood in general. In the time of David they were very numerous ([1 Chr. 12:27](/1chr#1Chr.12.27)). The other branches of the tribe of Levi held subordinate positions in connection with the sacred office. Aaron was a type of Christ in his official character as the high priest. His priesthood was a \u201cshadow of heavenly things,\u201d and was intended to lead the people of Israel to look forward to the time when \u201canother priest\u201d would arise \u201cafter the order of Melchizedek\u201d ([Heb. 6:20](/heb#Heb.6.20)). (See MOSES.)",

On this account Cain was angry with his brother, and formed the design of putting him to death; a design which he at length found an opportunity of carrying into effect ([Gen. 4:8](/gen#Gen.4.8), [9](/gen#Gen.4.9). Comp. [1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). There are several references to Abel in the New Testament. Our Saviour speaks of him as \u201crighteous\u201d ([Matt. 23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35)). \u201cThe blood of sprinkling\u201d is said to speak \u201cbetter things than that of Abel\u201d ([Heb. 12:24](/heb#Heb.12.24)); i.e., the blood of Jesus is the reality of which the blood of the offering made by Abel was only the type. The comparison here is between the sacrifice offered by Christ and that offered by Abel, and not between the blood of Christ calling for mercy and the blood of the murdered Abel calling for vengeance, as has sometimes been supposed. It is also said ([Heb. 11:4](/heb#Heb.11.4)) that \u201cAbel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain.\u201d This sacrifice was made \u201cby faith;\u201d this faith rested in God, not only as the Creator and the God of providence, but especially in God as the great Redeemer, whose sacrifice was typified by the sacrifices which, no doubt by the divine institution, were offered from the days of Adam downward. On account of that \u201cfaith\u201d which looked forward to the great atoning sacrifice, Abel\u2019s offering was accepted of God. Cain\u2019s offering had no such reference, and therefore was rejected. Abel was the first martyr, as he was the first of our race to die.\n\n Abel (Heb. \u2018abhel), lamentation ([1 Sam. 6:18](/1sam#1Sam.6.18)), the name given to the great stone in Joshua\u2019s field whereon the ark was \u201cset down.\u201d The Revised Version, however, following the Targum and the LXX., reads in the Hebrew text \u2019ebhen (= a stone), and accordingly translates \u201cunto the great stone, whereon they set down the ark.\u201d This reading is to be preferred.\n\n Abel (Heb. \u2018abhel), a grassy place, a meadow. This word enters into the composition of the following words:",

            "dictText": "Father of abundance, or my father excels, the son of Ahimelech the high priest. He was the tenth high priest, and the fourth in descent from Eli. When his father was slain with the priests of Nob, he escaped, and bearing with him the ephod, he joined David, who was then in the cave of Adullam ([1 Sam. 22:20-23](/1sam#1Sam.22.20); [23:6](/1sam#1Sam.23.6)). He remained with David, and became priest of the party of which he was the leader ([1 Sam. 30:7](/1sam#1Sam.30.7)). When David ascended the throne of Judah, Abiathar was appointed high priest ([1 Chr. 15:11](/1chr#1Chr.15.11); [1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26)) and the \u201cking\u2019s companion\u201d ([1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). Meanwhile Zadok, of the house of Eleazar, had been made high priest. These appointments continued in force till the end of David\u2019s reign ([1 Kings 4:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.4)). Abiathar was deposed (the sole historical instance of the deposition of a high priest) and banished to his home at Anathoth by Solomon, because he took part in the attempt to raise Adonijah to the throne. The priesthood thus passed from the house of Ithamar ([1 Sam. 2:30-36](/1sam#1Sam.2.30); [1 Kings 1:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.19); [2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26), [27](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.27)). Zadok now became sole high priest. In [Mark 2:26](/mark#Mark.2.26), reference is made to an occurrence in \u201cthe days of Abiathar the high priest.\u201d But from [1 Sam. 22](/1sam#1Sam.22), we learn explicitly that this event took place when Ahimelech, the father of Abiathar, was high priest. The apparent discrepancy is satisfactorily explained by interpreting the words in Mark as referring to the life-time of Abiathar, and not to the term of his holding the office of high priest. It is not implied in Mark that he was actual high priest at the time referred to. Others, however, think that the loaves belonged to Abiathar, who was at that time ([Lev. 24:9](/lev#Lev.24.9)) a priest, and that he either himself gave them to David, or persuaded his father to give them.",

His address to \u201cJeroboam and all Israel,\u201d before encountering them in battle, is worthy of being specially noticed ([2 Chr. 13:5-12](/2chr#2Chr.13.5)). It was a very bloody battle, no fewer than 500,000 of the army of Israel having perished on the field. He is described as having walked \u201cin all the sins of his father\u201d ([1 Kings 15:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.3); [2 Chr. 11:20-22](/2chr#2Chr.11.20)).

It is probable that \u201cUriel of Gibeah\u201d married Tamar, the daughter of Absalom ([2 Sam. 14:27](/2sam#2Sam.14.27)), and by her had Maachah.

He first introduced David to the court of Saul after the victory over Goliath ([1 Sam. 17:57](/1sam#1Sam.17.57)). After the death of Saul, David was made king over Judah, and reigned in Hebron. Among the other tribes there was a feeling of hostility to Judah; and Abner, at the head of Ephraim, fostered this hostility in the interest of the house of Saul, whose son Ish-bosheth he caused to be proclaimed king ([2 Sam. 2:8](/2sam#2Sam.2.8)). A state of war existed between these two kings. A battle fatal to Abner, who was the leader of Ish-boseth\u2019s army, was fought with David\u2019s army under Joab at Gibeon ([2 Sam. 2:12](/2sam#2Sam.2.12)). Abner, escaping from the field, was overtaken by Asahel, who was \u201clight of foot as a wild roe,\u201d the brother of Joab and Abishai, whom he thrust through with a back stroke of his spear ([2 Sam. 2](/2sam#2Sam.2): 18-32).\n\n Being rebuked by Ish-bosheth for the impropriety of taking to wife Rizpah, who had been a concubine of King Saul, he found an excuse for going over to the side of David, whom he now professed to regard as anointed by the Lord to reign over all Israel. David received him favourably, and promised that he would have command of the armies. At this time Joab was absent from Hebron, but on his return he found what had happened. Abner had just left the city; but Joab by a stratagem recalled him, and meeting him at the gate of the city on his return, thrust him through with his sword ([2 Sam. 3:27](/2sam#2Sam.3.27), [31](/2sam#2Sam.3.31)-39; 4:12. Comp. [1 Kings 2:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.5), [32](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.32)). David lamented in pathetic words the death of Abner, \u201cKnow ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?\u201d ([2 Sam. 3:33-38](/2sam#2Sam.3.33).)",

Till the age of seventy, Abram sojourned among his kindred in his native country of Chaldea. He then, with his father and his family and household, quitted the city of Ur, in which he had hitherto dwelt, and went some 300 miles north to Haran, where he abode fifteen years. The cause of his migration was a call from God ([Acts 7:2-4](/acts#Acts.7.2)). There is no mention of this first call in the Old Testament; it is implied, however, in [Gen. 12](/gen#Gen.12). While they tarried at Haran, Terah died at the age of 205 years. Abram now received a second and more definite call, accompanied by a promise from God ([Gen. 12:1](/gen#Gen.12.1), [2](/gen#Gen.12.2)); whereupon he took his departure, taking his nephew Lot with him, \u201cnot knowing whither he went\u201d ([Heb. 11:8](/heb#Heb.11.8)). He trusted implicitly to the guidance of Him who had called him.\n\n Abram now, with a large household of probably a thousand souls, entered on a migratory life, and dwelt in tents. Passing along the valley of the Jabbok, in the land of Canaan, he formed his first encampment at Sichem ([Gen. 12:6](/gen#Gen.12.6)), in the vale or oak-grove of Moreh, between Ebal on the north and Gerizim on the south. Here he received the great promise, \u201cI will make of thee a great nation,\u201d etc. ([Gen. 12:2](/gen#Gen.12.2), [3](/gen#Gen.12.3), [7](/gen#Gen.12.7)). This promise comprehended not only temporal but also spiritual blessings. It implied that he was the chosen ancestor of the great Deliverer whose coming had been long ago predicted ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)). Soon after this, for some reason not mentioned, he removed his tent to the mountain district between Bethel, then called Luz, and Ai, towns about two miles apart, where he built an altar to \u201cJehovah.\u201d He again moved into the southern tract of Palestine, called by the Hebrews the Negeb; and was at length, on account of a famine, compelled to go down into Egypt. This took place in the time of the Hyksos, a Semitic race which now held the Egyptians in bondage. Here occurred that case of deception on the part of Abram which exposed him to the rebuke of Pharaoh ([Gen. 12:18](/gen#Gen.12.18)). Sarai was restored to him; and Pharaoh loaded him with presents, recommending him to withdraw from the country. He returned to Canaan richer than when he left it, \u201cin cattle, in silver, and in gold\u201d ([Gen. 12:8](/gen#Gen.12.8); [13:2](/gen#Gen.13.2). Comp. [Ps. 105:13](/ps#Ps.105.13), [14](/ps#Ps.105.14)). The whole party then moved northward, and returned to their previous station near Bethel. Here disputes arose between Lot\u2019s shepherds and those of Abram about water and pasturage. Abram generously gave Lot his choice of the pasture-ground. (Comp. [1 Cor. 6:7](/1cor#1Cor.6.7).) He chose the well-watered plain in which Sodom was situated, and removed thither; and thus the uncle and nephew were separated. Immediately after this Abram was cheered by a repetition of the promises already made to him, and then removed to the plain or \u201coak-grove\u201d of Mamre, which is in Hebron. He finally settled here, pitching his tent under a famous oak or terebinth tree, called \u201cthe oak of Mamre\u201d ([Gen. 13:18](/gen#Gen.13.18)). This was his third resting-place in the land.\n\n Some fourteen years before this, while Abram was still in Chaldea, Palestine had been invaded by Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, who brought under tribute to him the five cities in the plain to which Lot had removed. This tribute was felt by the inhabitants of these cities to be a heavy burden, and after twelve years they revolted. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlaomer, who had in league with him four other kings. He ravaged the whole country, plundering the towns, and carrying the inhabitants away as slaves. Among those thus treated was Lot. Hearing of the disaster that had fallen on his nephew, Abram immediately gathered from his own household a band of 318 armed men, and being joined by the Amoritish chiefs Mamre, Aner, and Eshcol, he pursued after Chedorlaomer, and overtook him near the springs of the Jordan. They attacked and routed his army, and pursued it over the range of Anti-Libanus as far as to Hobah, near Damascus, and then returned, bringing back all the spoils that had been carried away. Returning by way of Salem, i.e., Jerusalem, the king of that place, Melchizedek, came forth to meet them with refreshments. To him Abram presented a tenth of the spoils, in recognition of his character as a priest of the most high God ([Gen. 14:18-20](/gen#Gen.14.18)).\n\n In a recently-discovered tablet, dated in the reign of the grandfather of Amraphel ([Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1)), one of the witnesses is called \u201cthe Amorite, the son of Abiramu,\u201d or Abram.\n\n Having returned to his home at Mamre, the promises already made to him by God were repeated and enlarged ([Gen. 13:14](/gen#Gen.13.14)). \u201cThe word of the Lord\u201d (an expression occurring here for the first time) \u201ccame to him\u201d (15:1). He now understood better the future that lay before the nation that was to spring from him. Sarai, now seventy-five years old, in her impatience, persuaded Abram to take Hagar, her Egyptian maid, as a concubine, intending that whatever child might be born should be reckoned as her own. Ishmael was accordingly thus brought up, and was regarded as the heir of these promises ([Gen. 16](/gen#Gen.16)). When Ishmael was thirteen years old, God again revealed yet more explicitly and fully his gracious purpose; and in token of the sure fulfilment of that purpose the patriarch\u2019s name was now changed from Abram to Abraham ([Gen. 17:4](/gen#Gen.17.4), [5](/gen#Gen.17.5)), and the rite of circumcision was instituted as a sign of the covenant. It was then announced that the heir to these covenant promises would be the son of Sarai, though she was now ninety years old; and it was directed that his name should be Isaac. At the same time, in commemoration of the promises, Sarai\u2019s name was changed to Sarah. On that memorable day of God\u2019s thus revealing his design, Abraham and his son Ishmael and all the males of his house were circumcised ([Gen. 17](/gen#Gen.17)). Three months after this, as Abraham sat in his tent door, he saw three men approaching. They accepted his proffered hospitality, and, seated under an oak-tree, partook of the fare which Abraham and Sarah provided. One of the three visitants was none other than the Lord, and the other two were angels in the guise of men. The Lord renewed on this occasion his promise of a son by Sarah, who was rebuked for her unbelief. Abraham accompanied the three as they proceeded on their journey. The two angels went on toward Sodom; while the Lord tarried behind and talked with Abraham, making known to him the destruction that was about to fall on that guilty city. The patriarch interceded earnestly in behalf of the doomed city. But as not even ten righteous persons were found in it, for whose sake the city would have been spared, the threatened destruction fell upon it; and early next morning Abraham saw the smoke of the fire that consumed it as the \u201csmoke of a furnace\u201d ([Gen. 19:1-28](/gen#Gen.19.1)).\n\n After fifteen years\u2019 residence at Mamre, Abraham moved southward, and pitched his tent among the Philistines, near to Gerar. Here occurred that sad instance of prevarication on his part in his relation to Abimelech the King ([Gen. 20](/gen#Gen.20)). (See ABIMELECH.) Soon after this event, the patriarch left the vicinity of Gerar, and moved down the fertile valley about 25 miles to Beer-sheba. It was probably here that Isaac was born, Abraham being now an hundred years old. A feeling of jealousy now arose between Sarah and Hagar, whose son, Ishmael, was no longer to be regarded as Abraham\u2019s heir. Sarah insisted that both Hagar and her son should be sent away. This was done, although it was a hard trial to Abraham ([Gen. 21:12](/gen#Gen.21.12)). (See  HAGAR; ISHMAEL.)\n\n At this point there is a blank in the patriarch\u2019s history of perhaps twenty-five years. These years of peace and happiness were spent at Beer-sheba. The next time we see him his faith is put to a severe test by the command that suddenly came to him to go and offer up Isaac, the heir of all the promises, as a sacrifice on one of the mountains of Moriah. His faith stood the test ([Heb. 11:17-19](/heb#Heb.11.17)). He proceeded in a spirit of unhesitating obedience to carry out the command; and when about to slay his son, whom he had laid on the altar, his uplifted hand was arrested by the angel of Jehovah, and a ram, which was entangled in a thicket near at hand, was seized and offered in his stead. From this circumstance that place was called Jehovah-jireh, i.e., \u201cThe Lord will provide.\u201d The promises made to Abraham were again confirmed (and this was the last recorded word of God to the patriarch); and he descended the mount with his son, and returned to his home at Beer-sheba ([Gen. 22:19](/gen#Gen.22.19)), where he resided for some years, and then moved northward to Hebron.\n\n Some years after this Sarah died at Hebron, being 127 years old. Abraham acquired now the needful possession of a burying-place, the cave of Machpelah, by purchase from the owner of it, Ephron the Hittite ([Gen. 23](/gen#Gen.23)); and there he buried Sarah. His next care was to provide a wife for Isaac, and for this purpose he sent his steward, Eliezer, to Haran (or Charran, [Acts 7:2](/acts#Acts.7.2)), where his brother Nahor and his family resided ([Gen. 11:31](/gen#Gen.11.31)). The result was that Rebekah, the daughter of Nahor\u2019s son Bethuel, became the wife of Isaac ([Gen. 24](/gen#Gen.24)). Abraham then himself took to wife Keturah, who became the mother of six sons, whose descendants were afterwards known as the \u201cchildren of the east\u201d ([Judg. 6:3](/judg#Judg.6.3)), and later as \u201cSaracens.\u201d At length all his wanderings came to an end. At the age of 175 years, 100 years after he had first entered the land of Canaan, he died, and was buried in the old family burying-place at Machpelah ([Gen. 25:7-10](/gen#Gen.25.7)).\n\n The history of Abraham made a wide and deep impression on the ancient world, and references to it are interwoven in the religious traditions of almost all Eastern nations. He is called \u201cthe friend of God\u201d ([James 2:23](/jas#Jas.2.23)), \u201cfaithful Abraham\u201d ([Gal. 3:9](/gal#Gal.3.9)), \u201cthe father of us all\u201d ([Rom. 4:16](/rom#Rom.4.16)).",

He was noted for his personal beauty and for the extra-ordinary profusion of the hair of his head ([2 Sam. 14:25](/2sam#2Sam.14.25),[26](/2sam#2Sam.14.26)). The first public act of his life was the blood-revenge he executed against Amnon, David\u2019s eldest son, who had basely wronged Absalom\u2019s sister Tamar. This revenge was executed at the time of the festivities connected with a great sheep-shearing at Baal-hazor. David\u2019s other sons fled from the place in horror, and brought the tidings of the death of Amnon to Jerusalem. Alarmed for the consequences of the act, Absalom fled to his grandfather at Geshur, and there abode for three years ([2 Sam. 3:3](/2sam#2Sam.3.3); [13:23-38](/2sam#2Sam.13.23)).\n\n David mourned his absent son, now branded with the guilt of fratricide. As the result of a stratagem carried out by a woman of Tekoah, Joab received David\u2019s sanction to invite Absalom back to Jerusalem. He returned accordingly, but two years elapsed before his father admitted him into his presence ([2 Sam. 14:28](/2sam#2Sam.14.28)). Absalom was now probably the oldest surviving son of David, and as he was of royal descent by his mother as well as by his father, he began to aspire to the throne. His pretensions were favoured by the people. By many arts he gained their affection; and after his return from Geshur ([2 Sam. 15:7](/2sam#2Sam.15.7); marg., R.V.) he went up to Hebron, the old capital of Judah, along with a great body of the people, and there proclaimed himself king. The revolt was so successful that David found it necessary to quit Jerusalem and flee to Mahanaim, beyond Jordan; where upon Absalom returned to Jerusalem and took possession of the throne without opposition. Ahithophel, who had been David\u2019s chief counsellor, deserted him and joined Absalom, whose chief counsellor he now became. Hushai also joined Absalom, but only for the purpose of trying to counteract the counsels of Ahithophel, and so to advantage David\u2019s cause. He was so far successful that by his advice, which was preferred to that of Ahithophel, Absalom delayed to march an army against his father, who thus gained time to prepare for the defence.\n\n Absalom at length marched out against his father, whose army, under the command of Joab, he encountered on the borders of the forest of Ephraim. Twenty thousand of Absalom\u2019s army were slain in that fatal battle, and the rest fled. Absalom fled on a swift mule; but his long flowing hair, or more probably his head, was caught in the bough of an oak, and there he was left suspended till Joab came up and pierced him through with three darts. His body was then taken down and cast into a pit dug in the forest, and a heap of stones was raised over his grave. When the tidings of the result of that battle were brought to David, as he sat impatiently at the gate of Mahanaim, and he was told that Absalom had been slain, he gave way to the bitter lamentation: \u201cO my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d ([2 Sam. 18:33](/2sam#2Sam.18.33). Comp. [Ex. 32:32](/exod#Exod.32.32); [Rom. 9:3](/rom#Rom.9.3)).\n\n Absalom\u2019s three sons ([2 Sam. 14:27](/2sam#2Sam.14.27); comp. 18:18) had all died before him, so that he left only a daughter, Tamar, who became the grandmother of Abijah.",

It was the name given to the first man, whose creation, fall, and subsequent history and that of his descendants are detailed in the first book of Moses ([Gen. 1:27](/gen#Gen.1.27)-ch. 5). \u201cGod created man [Heb., Adam] in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.\u201d\n\n Adam was absolutely the first man whom God created. He was formed out of the dust of the earth (and hence his name), and God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and gave him dominion over all the lower creatures ([Gen. 1:26](/gen#Gen.1.26); [2:7](/gen#Gen.2.7)). He was placed after his creation in the Garden of Eden, to cultivate it, and to enjoy its fruits under this one prohibition: \u201cOf the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\u201d\n\n The first recorded act of Adam was his giving names to the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, which God brought to him for this end. Thereafter the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and while in an unconscious state took one of his ribs, and closed up his flesh again; and of this rib he made a woman, whom he presented to him when he awoke. Adam received her as his wife, and said, \u201cThis is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.\u201d He called her Eve, because she was the mother of all living.\n\n Being induced by the tempter in the form of a serpent to eat the forbidden fruit, Eve persuaded Adam, and he also did eat. Thus man fell, and brought upon himself and his posterity all the sad consequences of his transgression. The narrative of the Fall comprehends in it the great promise of a Deliverer ([Gen. 3:15](/gen#Gen.3.15)), the \u201cfirst gospel\u201d message to man. They were expelled from Eden, and at the east of the garden God placed a flame, which turned every way, to prevent access to the tree of life ([Gen. 3](/gen#Gen.3)). How long they were in Paradise is matter of mere conjecture.\n\n Shortly after their expulsion Eve brought forth her first-born, and called him Cain. Although we have the names of only three of Adam\u2019s sons, viz., Cain, Abel, and Seth, yet it is obvious that he had several sons and daughters ([Gen. 5:4](/gen#Gen.5.4)). He died aged 930 years.\n\n Adam and Eve were the progenitors of the whole human race. Evidences of varied kinds are abundant in proving the unity of the human race. The investigations of science, altogether independent of historical evidence, lead to the conclusion that God \u201chath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth\u201d ([Acts 17:26](/acts#Acts.17.26). Comp. [Rom. 5:12-12](/rom#Rom.5.12); [1 Cor. 15:22-49](/1cor#1Cor.15.22)).",

His wife was Jezebel (q.v.), who exercised a very evil influence over him. To the calf-worship introduced by Jeroboam he added the worship of Baal. He was severely admonished by Elijah (q.v.) for his wickedness. His anger was on this account kindled against the prophet, and he sought to kill him. He undertook three campaigns against Ben-hadad II., king of Damascus. In the first two, which were defensive, he gained a complete victory over Ben-hadad, who fell into his hands, and was afterwards released on the condition of his restoring all the cities of Israel he then held, and granting certain other concessions to Ahab. After three years of peace, for some cause Ahab renewed war ([1 Kings 22:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.3)) with Ben-hadad by assaulting the city of Ramoth-gilead, although the prophet Micaiah warned him that he would not succeed, and that the 400 false prophets who encouraged him were only leading him to his ruin. Micaiah was imprisoned for thus venturing to dissuade Ahab from his purpose. Ahab went into the battle disguised, that he might if possible escape the notice of his enemies; but an arrow from a bow \u201cdrawn at a venture\u201d pierced him, and though stayed up in his chariot for a time he died towards evening, and Elijah\u2019s prophecy ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)) was fulfilled. He reigned twenty-three years. Because of his idolatry, lust, and covetousness, Ahab is referred to as pre-eminently the type of a wicked king ([2 Kings 8:18](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.18); [2 Chr. 22:3](/2chr#2Chr.22.3); [Micah 6:16](/mic#Mic.6.16)).",

He was the first to employ a mercenary army of 100,000 Israelite soldiers, which he did in his attempt to bring the Edomites again under the yoke of Judah ([2 Chr. 25:5](/2chr#2Chr.25.5), [6](/2chr#2Chr.25.6)). He was commanded by a prophet of the Lord to send back the mercenaries, which he did ([2 Chr. 25:7-10](/2chr#2Chr.25.7), [13](/2chr#2Chr.25.13)), much to their annoyance. His obedience to this command was followed by a decisive victory over the Edomites ([2 Chr. 25:14-16](/2chr#2Chr.25.14)). Amaziah began to worship some of the idols he took from the Edomites, and this was his ruin, for he was vanquished by Joash, king of Israel, whom he challenged to battle. The disaster he thus brought upon Judah by his infatuation in proclaiming war against Israel probably occasioned the conspiracy by which he lost his life ([2 Kings 14:8-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.8), [19](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.19)). He was slain at Lachish, whither he had fled, and his body was brought upon horses to Jerusalem, where it was buried in the royal sepulchre ([2 Kings 14:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.20); [2 Chr. 25:27](/2chr#2Chr.25.27), [28](/2chr#2Chr.25.28)).",

They seem to have originally occupied the land stretching from the heights west of the Dead Sea ([Gen. 14:7](/gen#Gen.14.7)) to Hebron (13. Comp. 13:8; [Deut. 3:8](/deut#Deut.3.8); [4:46-48](/deut#Deut.4.46)), embracing \u201call Gilead and all Bashan\u201d ([Deut. 3:10](/deut#Deut.3.10)), with the Jordan valley on the east of the river (4:49), the land of the \u201ctwo kings of the Amorites,\u201d Sihon and Og ([Deut. 31:4](/deut#Deut.31.4); [Josh. 2:10](/josh#Josh.2.10); [9:10](/josh#Josh.9.10)). The five kings of the Amorites were defeated with great slaughter by Joshua (10:10). They were again defeated at the waters of Merom by Joshua, who smote them till there were none remaining ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8)). It is mentioned as a surprising circumstance that in the days of Samuel there was peace between them and the Israelites ([1 Sam. 7:14](/1sam#1Sam.7.14)). The discrepancy supposed to exist between [Deut. 1:44](/deut#Deut.1.44) and [Num. 14:45](/num#Num.14.45) is explained by the circumstance that the terms \u201cAmorites\u201d and \u201cAmalekites\u201d are used synonymously for the \u201cCanaanites.\u201d In the same way we explain the fact that the \u201cHivites\u201d of [Gen. 34:2](/gen#Gen.34.2) are the \u201cAmorites\u201d of 48:22.

The Amorites were warlike mountaineers. They are represented on the Egyptian monuments with fair skins, light hair, blue eyes, aquiline noses, and pointed beards. They are supposed to have been men of great stature; their king, Og, is described by Moses as the last \u201cof the remnant of the giants\u201d ([Deut. 3:11](/deut#Deut.3.11)). Both Sihon and Og were independent kings. Only one word of the Amorite language survives, \u201cShenir,\u201d the name they gave to Mount Hermon ([Deut. 3:9](/deut#Deut.3.9)).",

This expression has occasioned some difficulty, as it is scarcely probable that Paul should have been ignorant of so public a fact. The expression may mean (a) that Paul had at the moment overlooked the honour due to the high priest; or (b), as others think, that Paul spoke ironically, as if he had said, \u201cThe high priest breaking the law! God\u2019s high priest a tyrant and a lawbreaker! I see a man in white robes, and have heard his voice, but surely it cannot, it ought not to be, the voice of the high priest.\u201d (See Dr. Lindsay on Acts, in loco.) (c) Others think that from defect of sight Paul could not observe that the speaker was the high priest.

On one occasion John the Baptist, whose disciple he then was, pointing to Jesus, said, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God\u201d ([John 1:40](/john#John.1.40)); and Andrew, hearing him, immediately became a follower of Jesus, the first of his disciples. After he had been led to recognize Jesus as the Messiah, his first care was to bring also his brother Simon to Jesus. The two brothers seem to have after this pursued for a while their usual calling as fishermen, and did not become the stated attendants of the Lord till after John\u2019s imprisonment ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [19](/matt#Matt.4.19); [Mark 1:16](/mark#Mark.1.16), [17](/mark#Mark.1.17)).

Our Lord was first brought before Annas, and after a brief questioning of him ([John 18:19-23](/john#John.18.19)) was sent to Caiaphas, when some members of the Sanhedrim had met, and the first trial of Jesus took place ([Matt. 26:57-68](/matt#Matt.26.57)). This examination of our Lord before Annas is recorded only by John. Annas was president of the Sanhedrim before which Peter and John were brought ([Acts 4:6](/acts#Acts.4.6)).",

The boundaries of the inheritance given to it, which contained some of the richest soil in Palestine, and the names of its towns, are recorded in [Josh. 19:24-31](/josh#Josh.19.24); [Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31), [32](/judg#Judg.1.32). Asher and Simeon were the only tribes west of the Jordan which furnished no hero or judge for the nation. Anna the prophetess was of this tribe ([Luke 2:36](/luke#Luke.2.36)).",

He resided at Pethor ([Deut. 23:4](/deut#Deut.23.4)), in Mesopotamia ([Num. 23:7](/num#Num.23.7)). It is evident that though dwelling among idolaters he had some knowledge of the true God; and was held in such reputation that it was supposed that he whom he blessed was blessed, and he whom he cursed was cursed. When the Israelites were encamped on the plains of Moab, on the east of Jordan, by Jericho, Balak sent for Balaam \u201cfrom Aram, out of the mountains of the east,\u201d to curse them; but by the remarkable interposition of God he was utterly unable to fulfil Balak\u2019s wish, however desirous he was to do so. The apostle Peter refers (2 Pet. 2:15, [16](/2pet#2Pet.2.16)) to this as an historical event. In [Micah 6:5](/mic#Mic.6.5) reference also is made to the relations between Balaam and Balak. Though Balaam could not curse Israel, yet he suggested a mode by which the divine displeasure might be caused to descend upon them ([Num. 25](/num#Num.25)). In a battle between Israel and the Midianites (q.v.) Balaam was slain while fighting on the side of Balak ([Num. 31:8](/num#Num.31.8)).\n\n The \u201cdoctrine of Balaam\u201d is spoken of in [Rev. 2:14](/rev#Rev.2.14), in allusion to the fact that it was through the teaching of Balaam that Balak learned the way by which the Israelites might be led into sin. (See NICOLAITANES.) Balaam was constrained to utter prophecies regarding the future of Israel of wonderful magnificence and beauty of expression ([Num. 24:5-9](/num#Num.24.5), [17](/num#Num.24.17)).",

Luke speaks of him as a \u201cgood man\u201d (11:24). He was born of Jewish parents of the tribe of Levi. He was a native of Cyprus, where he had a possession of land ([Acts 4:36](/acts#Acts.4.36), [37](/acts#Acts.4.37)), which he sold. His personal appearance is supposed to have been dignified and commanding ([Acts 14:11](/acts#Acts.14.11), [12](/acts#Acts.14.12)). When Paul returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). They had probably been companions as students in the school of Gamaliel.\n\n The prosperity of the church at Antioch led the apostles and brethren at Jerusalem to send Barnabas thither to superintend the movement. He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to Tarsus in search of Saul to assist him. Saul returned with him to Antioch and laboured with him for a whole year ([Acts 11:25](/acts#Acts.11.25), [26](/acts#Acts.11.26)). The two were at the end of this period sent up to Jerusalem with the contributions the church at Antioch had made for the poorer brethren there (11:28-30). Shortly after they returned, bringing John Mark with them, they were appointed as missionaries to the heathen world, and in this capacity visited Cyprus and some of the principal cities of Asia Minor ([Acts 13:14](/acts#Acts.13.14)). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church ([Acts 15:2](/acts#Acts.15.2): [Gal. 2:1](/gal#Gal.2.1)). This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the decree of the council as the rule by which Gentiles were to be admitted into the church.\n\n When about to set forth on a second missionary journey, a dispute arose between Saul and Barnabas as to the propriety of taking John Mark with them again. The dispute ended by Saul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Saul took Silas as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and Cilicia; while Barnabas took his nephew John Mark, and visited Cyprus ([Acts 15:36-41](/acts#Acts.15.36)). Barnabas is not again mentioned by Luke in the Acts.",

He was the son of Nabonidus by Nitocris, who was the daughter of Nebuchadnezzar and the widow of Nergal-sharezer. When still young he made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and when heated with wine sent for the sacred vessels his \u201cfather\u201d ([Dan. 5:2](/dan#Dan.5.2)), or grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar had carried away from the temple in Jerusalem, and he and his princes drank out of them. In the midst of their mad revelry a hand was seen by the king tracing on the wall the announcement of God\u2019s judgment, which that night fell upon him. At the instance of the queen (i.e., his mother) Daniel was brought in, and he interpreted the writing. That night the kingdom of the Chaldeans came to an end, and the king was slain ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)). (See NERGAL-SHAREZER.)\n\n The absence of the name of Belshazzar on the monuments was long regarded as an argument against the genuineness of the Book of Daniel. In 1854 Sir Henry Rawlinson found an inscription of Nabonidus which referred to his eldest son. Quite recently, however, the side of a ravine undermined by heavy rains fell at Hillah, a suburb of Babylon. A number of huge, coarse earthenware vases were laid bare. These were filled with tablets, the receipts and contracts of a firm of Babylonian bankers, which showed that Belshazzar had a household, with secretaries and stewards. One was dated in the third year of the king Marduk-sar-uzur. As Marduk-sar-uzar was another name for Baal, this Marduk-sar-uzur was found to be the Belshazzar of Scripture. In one of these contract tablets, dated in the July after the defeat of the army of Nabonidus, we find him paying tithes for his sister to the temple of the sun-god at Sippara.",

His birth took place at Ephrath, on the road between Bethel and Bethlehem, at a short distance from the latter place. His mother died in giving him birth, and with her last breath named him Ben-oni, son of my pain, a name which was changed by his father into Benjamin. His posterity are called Benjamites ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27); [Deut. 33:12](/deut#Deut.33.12); [Josh. 18:21](/josh#Josh.18.21)).\n\n The tribe of Benjamin at the Exodus was the smallest but one ([Num. 1:36](/num#Num.1.36), [37](/num#Num.1.37); [Ps. 68:27](/ps#Ps.68.27)). During the march its place was along with Manasseh and Ephraim on the west of the tabernacle. At the entrance into Canaan it counted 45,600 warriors. It has been inferred by some from the words of Jacob ([Gen. 49:27](/gen#Gen.49.27)) that the figure of a wolf was on the tribal standard. This tribe is mentioned in [Rom. 11:1](/rom#Rom.11.1); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5).\n\n The inheritance of this tribe lay immediately to the south of that of Ephraim, and was about 26 miles in length and 12 in breadth. Its eastern boundary was the Jordan. Dan intervened between it and the Philistines. Its chief towns are named in [Josh. 18:21-28](/josh#Josh.18.21).\n\n The history of the tribe contains a sad record of a desolating civil war in which they were engaged with the other eleven tribes. By it they were almost exterminated ([Judg. 20:20](/judg#Judg.20.20), [21](/judg#Judg.20.21); 21:10). (See GIBEAH.)\n\n The first king of the Jews was Saul, a Benjamite. A close alliance was formed between this tribe and that of Judah in the time of David ([2 Sam. 19:16](/2sam#2Sam.19.16), [17](/2sam#2Sam.19.17)), which continued after his death ([1 Kings 11:13](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.13); [12:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.20)). After the Exile these two tribes formed the great body of the Jewish nation ([Ezra 1:5](/ezra#Ezra.1.5); [10:9](/ezra#Ezra.10.9)).\n\n The tribe of Benjamin was famous for its archers ([1 Sam. 20:20](/1sam#1Sam.20.20), [36](/1sam#1Sam.20.36); [2 Sam. 1:22](/2sam#2Sam.1.22); [1 Chr. 8:40](/1chr#1Chr.8.40); [12:2](/1chr#1Chr.12.2)) and slingers (Judge. 20:6).\n\n The gate of Benjamin, on the north side of Jerusalem ([Jer. 37:13](/jer#Jer.37.13); [38:7](/jer#Jer.38.7); [Zech. 14:10](/zech#Zech.14.10)), was so called because it led in the direction of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. It is called by Jeremiah (20:2) \u201cthe high gate of Benjamin;\u201d also \u201cthe gate of the children of the people\u201d (17:19). (Comp. [2 Kings 14:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.13).)",

He held this office during the whole of Pilate\u2019s administration. His wife was the daughter of Annas, who had formerly been high priest, and was probably the vicar or deputy (Heb. sagan) of Caiaphas. He was of the sect of the Sadducees ([Acts 5:17](/acts#Acts.5.17)), and was a member of the council when he gave his opinion that Jesus should be put to death \u201cfor the people, and that the whole nation perish not\u201d ([John 11:50](/john#John.11.50)). In these words he unconsciously uttered a prophecy. \u201cLike Saul, he was a prophet in spite of himself.\u201d Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, and therefore Jesus was sent to Pilate, the Roman governor, that he might duly pronounce the sentence against him ([Matt. 27:2](/matt#Matt.27.2); [John 18:28](/john#John.18.28)). At a later period his hostility to the gospel is still manifest ([Acts 4:6](/acts#Acts.4.6)). (See ANNAS.)",

On this account Cain was \u201cvery wroth,\u201d and cherished feelings of murderous hatred against his brother, and was at length guilty of the desperate outrage of putting him to death ([1 John 3:12](/1john#1John.3.12)). For this crime he was expelled from Eden, and henceforth led the life of an exile, bearing upon him some mark which God had set upon him in answer to his own cry for mercy, so that thereby he might be protected from the wrath of his fellow-men; or it may be that God only gave him some sign to assure him that he would not be slain ([Gen. 4:15](/gen#Gen.4.15)). Doomed to be a wanderer and a fugitive in the earth, he went forth into the \u201cland of Nod\u201d, i.e., the land of \u201cexile\u201d, which is said to have been in the \u201ceast of Eden,\u201d and there he built a city, the first we read of, and called it after his son\u2019s name, Enoch. His descendants are enumerated to the sixth generation. They gradually degenerated in their moral and spiritual condition till they became wholly corrupt before God. This corruption prevailed, and at length the Deluge was sent by God to prevent the final triumph of evil. (See ABEL.)",

The country which she ruled was called by the Greeks Meroe, in Upper Nubia. It was long the centre of commercial intercourse between Africa and the south of Asia, and hence became famous for its wealth ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)).\n\n It is somewhat singular that female sovereignty seems to have prevailed in Ethiopia, the name Candace (compare \u201cPharaoh,\u201d \u201cPtolemy,\u201d \u201cCaesar\u201d) being a title common to several successive queens. It is probable that Judaism had taken root in Ethiopia at this time, and hence the visit of the queen\u2019s treasurer to Jerusalem to keep the feast. There is a tradition that Candace was herself converted to Christianity by her treasurer on his return, and that he became the apostle of Christianity in that whole region, carrying it also into Abyssinia. It is said that he also preached the gospel in Arabia Felix and in Ceylon, where he suffered martyrdom. (See PHILIP.)",

Many centuries before the age of Abraham, Canaan and even the Sinaitic peninsula had been conquered by Babylonian kings, and in the time of Abraham himself Babylonia was ruled by a dynasty which claimed sovereignity over Syria and Palestine. The kings of the dynasty bore names which were not Babylonian, but at once South Arabic and Hebrew. The most famous king of the dynasty was Khammu-rabi, who united Babylonia under one rule, and made Babylon its capital. When he ascended the throne, the country was under the suzerainty of the Elamites, and was divided into two kingdoms, that of Babylon (the Biblical Shinar) and that of Larsa (the Biblical Ellasar). The king of Larsa was Eri-Aku (\u201cthe servant of the moon-god\u201d), the son of an Elamite prince, Kudur-Mabug, who is entitled \u201cthe father of the land of the Amorites.\u201d A recently discovered tablet enumerates among the enemies of Khammu-rabi, Kudur-Lagamar (\u201cthe servant of the goddess Lagamar\u201d) or Chedorlaomer, Eri-Aku or Arioch, and Tudkhula or Tidal. Khammu-rabi, whose name is also read Ammi-rapaltu or Amraphel by some scholars, succeeded in overcoming Eri-Aku and driving the Elamites out of Babylonia. Assur-bani-pal, the last of the Assyrian conquerors, mentions in two inscriptions that he took Susa 1635 years after Kedor-nakhunta, king of Elam, had conquered Babylonia. It was in the year B.C. 660 that Assur-bani-pal took Susa.",

He is Jesus the Christ ([Acts 17:3](/acts#Acts.17.3); [18:5](/acts#Acts.18.5); [Matt. 22:42](/matt#Matt.22.42)), the Anointed One.

This is he \u201cof whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.\u201d The Old Testament Scripture is full of prophetic declarations regarding the Great Deliverer and the work he was to accomplish. Jesus the Christ is Jesus the Great Deliverer, the Anointed One, the Saviour of men. This name denotes that Jesus was divinely appointed, commissioned, and accredited as the Saviour of men ([Heb. 5:4](/heb#Heb.5.4); [Isa. 11:2-4](/isa#Isa.11.2); [49:6](/isa#Isa.49.6); [John 5:37](/john#John.5.37); [Acts 2:22](/acts#Acts.2.22)).\n\n To believe that \u201cJesus is the Christ\u201d is to believe that he is the Anointed, the Messiah of the prophets, the Saviour sent of God, that he was, in a word, what he claimed to be. This is to believe the gospel, by the faith of which alone men can be brought unto God. That Jesus is the Christ is the testimony of God, and the faith of this constitutes a Christian ([1 Cor. 12:3](/1cor#1Cor.12.3); [1 John 5:1](/1john#1John.5.1)).",

From him the land of Cush seems to have derived its name. The question of the precise locality of the land of Cush has given rise to not a little controversy. The second river of Paradise surrounded the whole land of Cush ([Gen. 2:13](/gen#Gen.2.13), R.V.). The term Cush is in the Old Testament generally applied to the countries south of the Israelites. It was the southern limit of Egypt ([Ezek. 29:10](/ezek#Ezek.29.10), A.V. \u201cEthiopia,\u201d Heb. Cush), with which it is generally associated ([Ps. 68:31](/ps#Ps.68.31); [Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Jer. 46:9](/jer#Jer.46.9), etc.). It stands also associated with Elam ([Isa. 11:11](/isa#Isa.11.11)), with Persia ([Ezek. 38:5](/ezek#Ezek.38.5)), and with the Sabeans ([Isa. 45:14](/isa#Isa.45.14)). From these facts it has been inferred that Cush included Arabia and the country on the west coast of the Red Sea. Rawlinson takes it to be the country still known as Khuzi-stan, on the east side of the Lower Tigris. But there are intimations which warrant the conclusion that there was also a Cush in Africa, the Ethiopia (so called by the Greeks) of Africa. Ezekiel speaks (29:10; comp. 30:4-6) of it as lying south of Egypt. It was the country now known to us as Nubia and Abyssinia ([Isa. 18:1](/isa#Isa.18.1); [Zeph. 3:10](/zeph#Zeph.3.10), Heb. Cush). In ancient Egyptian inscriptions Ethiopia is termed Kesh. The Cushites appear to have spread along extensive tracts, stretching from the Upper Nile to the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early period there was a stream of migration of Cushites \u201cfrom Ethiopia, properly so called, through Arabia, Babylonia, and Persia, to Western India.\u201d The Hamite races, soon after their arrival in Africa, began to spread north, east, and west. Three branches of the Cushite or Ethiopian stock, moving from Western Asia, settled in the regions contiguous to the Persian Gulf. One branch, called the Cossaeans, settled in the mountainous district on the east of the Tigris, known afterwards as Susiana; another occupied the lower regions of the Euphrates and the Tigris; while a third colonized the southern shores and islands of the gulf, whence they afterwards emigrated to the Mediterranean and settled on the coast of Palestine as the Phoenicians. Nimrod was a great Cushite chief. He conquered the Accadians, a Tauranian race, already settled in Mesopotamia, and founded his kingdom, the Cushites mingling with the Accads, and so forming the Chaldean nation.",

Ko\u2019resh), the celebrated \u201cKing of Persia\u201d (Elam) who was conqueror of Babylon, and issued the decree of liberation to the Jews ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1), [2](/ezra#Ezra.1.2)). He was the son of Cambyses, the prince of Persia, and was born about B.C. 599. In the year B.C. 559 he became king of Persia, the kingdom of Media being added to it partly by conquest. Cyrus was a great military leader, bent on universal conquest. Babylon fell before his army (B.C. 538) on the night of Belshazzar\u2019s feast ([Dan. 5:30](/dan#Dan.5.30)), and then the ancient dominion of Assyria was also added to his empire (cf., \u201cGo up, O Elam\u201d, [Isa. 21:2](/isa#Isa.21.2)).\n\n Hitherto the great kings of the earth had only oppressed the Jews. Cyrus was to them as a \u201cshepherd\u201d ([Isa. 44:28](/isa#Isa.44.28); [45:1](/isa#Isa.45.1)). God employed him in doing service to his ancient people. He may posibly have gained, through contact with the Jews, some knowledge of their religion.\n\n The \u201cfirst year of Cyrus\u201d ([Ezra 1:1](/ezra#Ezra.1.1)) is not the year of his elevation to power over the Medes, nor over the Persians, nor the year of the fall of Babylon, but the year succeeding the two years during which \u201cDarius the Mede\u201d was viceroy in Babylon after its fall. At this time only (B.C. 536) Cyrus became actual king over Palestine, which became a part of his Babylonian empire. The edict of Cyrus for the rebuilding of Jerusalem marked a great epoch in the history of the Jewish people ([2 Chr. 36:22](/2chr#2Chr.36.22), [23](/2chr#2Chr.36.23); [Ezra 1:1-4](/ezra#Ezra.1.1); [4:3](/ezra#Ezra.4.3); [5:13-17](/ezra#Ezra.5.13); [6:3-5](/ezra#Ezra.6.3)).\n\n This decree was discovered \u201cat Achmetha [R.V. marg., \u201cEcbatana\u201d], in the palace that is in the province of the Medes\u201d ([Ezra 6:2](/ezra#Ezra.6.2)). A chronicle drawn up just after the conquest of Babylonia by Cyrus, gives the history of the reign of Nabonidus (Nabunahid), the last king of Babylon, and of the fall of the Babylonian empire. In B.C. 538 there was a revolt in Southern Babylonia, while the army of Cyrus entered the country from the north. In June the Babylonian army was completely defeated at Opis, and immediately afterwards Sippara opened its gates to the conqueror. Gobryas (Ugbaru), the governor of Kurdistan, was then sent to Babylon, which surrendered \u201cwithout fighting,\u201d and the daily services in the temples continued without a break. In October, Cyrus himself arrived, and proclaimed a general amnesty, which was communicated by Gobryas to \u201call the province of Babylon,\u201d of which he had been made governor. Meanwhile, Nabonidus, who had concealed himself, was captured, but treated honourably; and when his wife died, Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, conducted the funeral. Cyrus now assumed the title of \u201cking of Babylon,\u201d claimed to be the descendant of the ancient kings, and made rich offerings to the temples. At the same time he allowed the foreign populations who had been deported to Babylonia to return to their old homes, carrying with them the images of their gods. Among these populations were the Jews, who, as they had no images, took with them the sacred vessels of the temple.",

            "dictText": "The fifth son of Jacob. His mother was Bilhah, Rachel\u2019s maid ([Gen. 30:6](/gen#Gen.30.6), \u201cGod hath judged me\u201d, Heb. dananni). The blessing pronounced on him by his father was, \u201cDan shall judge his people\u201d (49:16), probably in allusion to the judgeship of Samson, who was of the tribe of Dan.\n\n The tribe of Dan had their place in the march through the wilderness on the north side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:25](/num#Num.2.25), [31](/num#Num.2.31); 10:25). It was the last of the tribes to receive a portion in the Land of Promise. Its position and extent are described in [Josh. 19:40-48](/josh#Josh.19.40).\n\n The territory of Dan extended from the west of that of Ephraim and Benjamin to the sea. It was a small territory, but was very fertile. It included in it, among others, the cities of Lydda, Ekron, and Joppa, which formed its northern boundary. But this district was too limited. \u201cSqueezed into the narrow strip between the mountains and the sea, its energies were great beyond its numbers.\u201d Being pressed by the Amorites and the Philistines, whom they were unable to conquer, they longed for a wider space. They accordingly sent out five spies from two of their towns, who went north to the sources of the Jordan, and brought back a favourable report regarding that region. \u201cArise,\u201d they said, \u201cbe not slothful to go, and to possess the land,\u201d for it is \u201ca place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth\u201d ([Judg. 18:10](/judg#Judg.18.10)). On receiving this report, 600 Danites girded on their weapons of war, and taking with them their wives and their children, marched to the foot of Hermon, and fought against Leshem, and took it from the Sidonians, and dwelt therein, and changed the name of the conquered town to Dan ([Josh. 19:47](/josh#Josh.19.47)). This new city of Dan became to them a new home, and was wont to be spoken of as the northern limit of Palestine, the length of which came to be denoted by the expression \u201cfrom Dan to Beersheba\u201d, i.e., about 144 miles.\n\n \u201cBut like Lot under a similar temptation, they seem to have succumbed to the evil influences around them, and to have sunk down into a condition of semi-heathenism from which they never emerged. The mounds of ruins which mark the site of the city show that it covered a considerable extent of ground. But there remains no record of any noble deed wrought by the degenerate tribe. Their name disappears from the roll-book of the natural and the spiritual Israel.\u201d, Manning\u2019s Those Holy Fields.\n\n This old border city was originally called Laish. Its modern name is Tell el-Kady, \u201cHill of the Judge.\u201d It stands about four miles below Caesarea Philippi, in the midst of a region of surpassing richness and beauty.",

            "dictText": "Beloved, the eighth and youngest son of Jesse, a citizen of Bethlehem. His father seems to have been a man in humble life. His mother\u2019s name is not recorded. Some think she was the Nahash of [2 Sam. 17:25](/2sam#2Sam.17.25). As to his personal appearance, we only know that he was red-haired, with beautiful eyes and a fair face ([1 Sam. 16:12](/1sam#1Sam.16.12); [17:42](/1sam#1Sam.17.42)).\n\n His early occupation was that of tending his father\u2019s sheep on the uplands of Judah. From what we know of his after history, doubtless he frequently beguiled his time, when thus engaged, with his shepherd\u2019s flute, while he drank in the many lessons taught him by the varied scenes spread around him. His first recorded exploits were his encounters with the wild beasts of the field. He mentions that with his own unaided hand he slew a lion and also a bear, when they came out against his flock, beating them to death in open conflict with his club ([1 Sam. 17:34](/1sam#1Sam.17.34), [35](/1sam#1Sam.17.35)).\n\n While David, in the freshness of ruddy youth, was thus engaged with his flocks, Samuel paid an unexpected visit to Bethlehem, having been guided thither by divine direction ([1 Sam. 16:1-13](/1sam#1Sam.16.1)). There he offered up sacrifice, and called the elders of Israel and Jesse\u2019s family to the sacrificial meal. Among all who appeared before him he failed to discover the one he sought. David was sent for, and the prophet immediately recognized him as the chosen of God, chosen to succeed Saul, who was now departing from the ways of God, on the throne of the kingdom. He accordingly, in anticipation, poured on his head the anointing oil. David went back again to his shepherd life, but \u201cthe Spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward,\u201d and \u201cthe Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul\u201d ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.16.14)).\n\n Not long after this David was sent for to soothe with his harp the troubled spirit of Saul, who suffered from a strange melancholy dejection. He played before the king so skilfully that Saul was greatly cheered, and began to entertain great affection for the young shepherd. After this he went home to Bethlehem. But he soon again came into prominence. The armies of the Philistines and of Israel were in battle array in the valley of Elah, some 16 miles south-west of Bethlehem; and David was sent by his father with provisions for his three brothers, who were then fighting on the side of the king. On his arrival in the camp of Israel, David (now about twenty years of age) was made aware of the state of matters when the champion of the Philistines, Goliath of Gath, came forth to defy Israel. David took his sling, and with a well-trained aim threw a stone \u201cout of the brook,\u201d which struck the giant\u2019s forehead, so that he fell senseless to the ground. David then ran and slew him, and cut off his head with his own sword ([1 Sam. 17](/1sam#1Sam.17)). The result was a great victory to the Israelites, who pursued the Philistines to the gates of Gath and Ekron.\n\n David\u2019s popularity consequent on this heroic exploit awakened Saul\u2019s jealousy ([1 Sam. 18:6-16](/1sam#1Sam.18.6)), which he showed in various ways. He conceived a bitter hatred toward him, and by various stratagems sought his death ([1 Sam. 18](/1sam#1Sam.18)-30). The deep-laid plots of the enraged king, who could not fail to observe that David \u201cprospered exceedingly,\u201d all proved futile, and only endeared the young hero the more to the people, and very specially to Jonathan, Saul\u2019s son, between whom and David a life-long warm friendship was formed.\n\n A fugitive. To escape from the vengeance of Saul, David fled to Ramah ([1 Sam. 19:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.19.12)) to Samuel, who received him, and he dwelt among the sons of the prophets, who were there under Samuel\u2019s training. It is supposed by some that the sixth, seventh, and eleventh Psalms were composed by him at this time. This place was only 3 miles from the residence of Saul, who soon discovered whither the fugitive had gone, and tried ineffectually to bring him back. Jonathan made a fruitless effort to bring his father to a better state of mind toward David ([1 Sam. 20](/1sam#1Sam.20)), who, being made aware of the fact, saw no hope of safety but in flight to a distance. We accordingly find him first at Nob (21:1-9) and then at Gath, the chief city of the Philistines. The king of the Philistines would not admit him into his service, as he expected that he would, and David accordingly now betook himself to the stronghold of Adullam (22:1-4; [1 Chr. 12:8-18](/1chr#1Chr.12.8)). Here in a short time 400 men gathered around him and acknowledged him as their leader. It was at this time that David, amid the harassment and perils of his position, cried, \u201cOh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem;\u201d when three of his heroes broke through the lines of the Philistines and brought him the water for which he longed ([2 Sam. 23:13-17](/2sam#2Sam.23.13)), but which he would not drink.\n\n In his rage at the failure of all his efforts to seize David, Saul gave orders for the massacre of the entire priestly family at Nob, \u201cpersons who wore a linen ephod\u201d, to the number of eighty-five persons, who were put to death by Doeg the Edomite. The sad tidings of the massacre were brought to David by Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, the only one who escaped. Comp. [Ps. 52](/ps#Ps.52).\n\n Hearing that Keilah, a town on the western frontier, was harassed by the Philistines, David with his men relieved it ([1 Sam. 23:1-14](/1sam#1Sam.23.1)); and then, for fear of Saul, he fled to the strongholds in the \u201chill country\u201d of Judah. Comp. [Ps. 31](/ps#Ps.31). While encamped there, in the forest in the district of Ziph, he was visited by Jonathan, who spoke to him words of encouragement (23:16-18). The two now parted never to meet again. Saul continued his pursuit of David, who narrowly escaped from him at this time, and fled to the crags and ravines of Engedi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea ([1 Sam. 23:29](/1sam#1Sam.23.29)). Here Saul, who still pursued him with his army, narrowly escaped, through the generous forbearance of David, and was greatly affected by what David had done for him. He returned home from pursuing him, and David betook himself to Maon, where, with his 600 men, he maintained himself by contributions gathered from the district. Here occurred the incident connected with Nabal and his wife Abigail ([1 Sam. 25](/1sam#1Sam.25)), whom David married after Nabal\u2019s death.\n\n Saul again went forth ([1 Sam. 26](/1sam#1Sam.26)) in pursuit of David, who had hid himself \u201cin the hill Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon,\u201d in the wilderness of Ziph, and was a second time spared through his forbearance. He returned home, professing shame and penitence for the way in which he had treated David, and predicting his elevation to the throne.\n\n Fighting against Israel. Harassed by the necessity of moving from place to place through fear of Saul, David once more sought refuge among the Philistines ([1 Sam. 27](/1sam#1Sam.27)). He was welcomed by the king, who assigned him Ziklag as his residence. Here David lived among his followers for some time as an independent chief engaged in frequent war with the Amalekites and other tribes on the south of Judah.\n\n Achish summoned David with his men to join his army against Saul; but the lords of the Philistines were suspicious of David\u2019s loyalty, and therefore he was sent back to Ziklag, which he found to his dismay may had been pillaged and burnt during his brief absence. David pursued after the raiders, the Amalekites, and completely routed them. On his return to Ziklag tidings reached him of Saul\u2019s death ([2 Sam. 1](/2sam#2Sam.1)). An Amalekite brought Saul\u2019s crown and bracelet and laid them at his feet. David and his men rent their clothes and mourned for Saul, who had been defeated in battle near Mount Gilboa. David composed a beautiful elegy, the most beautiful of all extant Hebrew odes, a \u201clamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son\u201d ([2 Sam. 1:18-27](/2sam#2Sam.1.18)). It bore the title of \u201cThe Bow,\u201d and was to be taught to the children, that the memory of Saul and Jonathan might be preserved among them. \u201cBehold, it is written in the book of Jasher\u201d (q.v.).\n\n David king over Judah. David and his men now set out for Hebron under divine direction ([2 Sam. 2:1-4](/2sam#2Sam.2.1)). There they were cordially welcomed, and he was at once anointed as king. He was now about thirty years of age.\n\n But his title to the throne was not undisputed. Abner took Ish-bosheth, Saul\u2019s only remaining son, over the Jordan to Mahanaim, and there crowned him as king. Then began a civil war in Israel. The first encounter between the two opposing armies, led on the one side by Abner, and on the other by Joab, took place at the pool of Gibeon. It resulted in the defeat of Abner. Other encounters, however, between Israel and Judah followed ([2 Sam. 3:1](/2sam#2Sam.3.1), [5](/2sam#2Sam.3.5)), but still success was on the side of David. For the space of seven and a half years David reigned in Hebron. Abner now sided with David, and sought to promote his advancement; but was treacherously put to death by Joab in revenge for his having slain his brother Asahel at Gibeon (3:22-39). This was greatly to David\u2019s regret. He mourned for the death of Abner. Shortly after this Ish-bosheth was also treacherously put to death by two Canaanites of Beeroth; and there being now no rival, David was anointed king over all Israel (4:1-12).\n\n David king over all Israel ([2 Sam. 5:1-5](/2sam#2Sam.5.1); [1 Chr. 11:1-3](/1chr#1Chr.11.1)). The elders of Israel now repaired to Hebron and offered allegiance to David in name of all the people, among whom the greatest enthusiasm prevailed. He was anointed king over all Israel, and sought out a new seat of government, more suitable than Hebron, as the capital of his empire. At this time there was a Jebusite fortress, \u201cthe stronghold\u201d, on the hill of Zion, called also Jebus. This David took from the Jebusites, and made it Israel\u2019s capital, and established here his residence, and afterwards built for himself a palace by the aid of Tyrian tradesmen. The Philistines, who had for some time observed a kind of truce, now made war against David; but were defeated in battle at a place afterwards called, in remembrance of the victory, Baal-perazim. Again they invaded the land, and were a second time routed by him. He thus delivered Israel from their enemies.\n\n David now resolved to bring up the ark of the covenant to his new capital ([2 Sam. 6](/2sam#2Sam.6)). It was in the house of Abinadab at Kirjath-jearim, about 7 miles from Jerusalem, where it had been for many years, from the time when the Philistines had sent it home ([1 Sam. 6](/1sam#1Sam.6); [7](/1sam#1Sam.7)). In consequence of the death of Uzzah (for it was a divine ordinance that only the Levites should handle the ark, [Num. 4](/num#Num.4)), who had put forth his hand to steady the ark when the cart in which it was being conveyed shook by reason of the roughness of the road, David stayed the procession, and conveyed the ark into the house of Obed-edom, a Philistine from Gath. After three months David brought the ark from the house of Obed-edom up to Jerusalem. Comp. [Ps. 24](/ps#Ps.24). Here it was placed in a new tent or tabernacle which David erected for the purpose. About seventy years had passed since it had stood in the tabernacle at Shiloh. The old tabernacle was now at Gibeah, at which Zadok ministered. David now ([1 Chr. 16](/1chr#1Chr.16)) carefully set in order all the ritual of divine worship at Jerusalem, along with Abiathar the high priest. A new religious era began. The service of praise was for the first time introduced into public worship. Zion became henceforth \u201cGod\u2019s holy hill.\u201d\n\n David\u2019s wars. David now entered on a series of conquests which greatly extended and strengthened his kingdom ([2 Sam. 8](/2sam#2Sam.8)). In a few years the whole territory from the Euphrates to the river of Egypt, and from Gaza on the west to Thapsacus on the east, was under his sway ([2 Sam. 8:3-13](/2sam#2Sam.8.3); [10](/2sam#2Sam.10)).\n\n David\u2019s fall. He had now reached the height of his glory. He ruled over a vast empire, and his capital was enriched with the spoils of many lands. But in the midst of all this success he fell, and his character became stained with the sin of adultery ([2 Sam. 11:2-27](/2sam#2Sam.11.2)). It has been noted as characteristic of the Bible that while his military triumphs are recorded in a few verses, the sad story of his fall is given in detail, a story full of warning, and therefore recorded. This crime, in the attempt to conceal it, led to anoter. He was guilty of murder. Uriah, whom he had foully wronged, an officer of the Gibborim, the corps of heros (23:39), was, by his order, \u201cset in the front of the hottest battle\u201d at the siege of Rabbah, in order that he might be put to death. Nathan the prophet ([2 Sam. 7:1-17](/2sam#2Sam.7.1); [12:1-23](/2sam#2Sam.12.1)) was sent by God to bring home his crimes to the conscience of the guilty monarch. He became a true penitent. He bitterly bewailed his sins before God. The thirty-second and fifty-first Psalms reveal the deep struggles of his soul, and his spiritual recovery.\n\n Bathsheba became his wife after Uriah\u2019s death. Her first-born son died, according to the word of the prophet. She gave birth to a second son, whom David called Solomon, and who ultimately succeeded him on the throne ([2 Sam. 12:24](/2sam#2Sam.12.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.12.25)).\n\n Peace. After the successful termination of all his wars, David formed the idea of building a temple for the ark of God. This he was not permitted to carry into execution, because he had been a man of war. God, however, sent Nathan to him with a gracious message ([2 Sam. 7:1-16](/2sam#2Sam.7.1)). On receiving it he went into the sanctuary, the tent where the ark was, and sat before the Lord, and poured out his heart in words of devout thanksgiving (18-29). The building of the temple was reserved for his son Solomon, who would be a man of peace ([1 Chr. 22:9](/1chr#1Chr.22.9); [28:3](/1chr#1Chr.28.3)).\n\n A cloudy evening. Hitherto David\u2019s carrer had been one of great prosperity and success. Now cloudy and dark days came. His eldest son Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam of Jezreel, was guilty of a great and shameful crime ([2 Sam. 13](/2sam#2Sam.13)). This was the beginning of the disasters of his later years. After two years Absalom terribly avenged the crime against Tamar, and put Amnon to death. This brought sore trouble to David\u2019s heart. Absalom, afraid of the consequences of his guilt, fled to Geshur beyond Jordan, where he remained for three years, when he was brought back through the intrigue of Joab ([2 Sam. 14](/2sam#2Sam.14)).\n\n After this there fell upon the land the calamity of three years\u2019 famine ([2 Sam. 21:1-14](/2sam#2Sam.21.1)). This was soon after followed by a pestilence, brought upon the land as a punishment for David\u2019s sinful pride in numbering the people ([2 Sam. 24](/2sam#2Sam.24)), in which no fewer than 70,000 perished in the space of three days.\n\n Rebellion of Absalom. The personal respect for David was sadly lowered by the incident of Bathsheba. There was a strong popular sentiment against the taking of the census, and the outburst of the plague in connection with it deepened the feeling of jealously that had begun to manifest itself among some of the tribes against David. Absalom, taking full advantage of this state of things, gradually gained over the people, and at length openly rebelled against his father, and usurped the throne. Ahithophel was Absalom\u2019s chief counsellor. The revolt began in Hebron, the capital of Judah. Absalom was there proclaimed king. David was now in imminent danger, and he left Jerusalem ([2 Sam. 15:13-20](/2sam#2Sam.15.13)), and once more became a fugitive. It was a momentous day in Israel. The incidents of it are recorded with a fulness of detail greater than of any other day in Old Testament history. David fled with his followers to Mahanarm, on the east of Jordan. An unnatural civil war broke out. After a few weeks the rival armies were mustered and organized. They met in hostile array at the wood of Ephraim ([2 Sam. 18:1-8](/2sam#2Sam.18.1)). Absalom\u2019s army was defeated, and himself put to death by the hand of Joab (9-18). The tidings of the death of his rebellious son filled the heart of David with the most poignant grief. He \u201cwent up to the chamber over the gate, and wept\u201d (33), giving utterance to the heart-broken cry, \u201cWould God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\u201d Peace was now restored, and David returned to Jerusalem and resumed the direction of affairs. An unhappy dispute arose between the men of Judah and the men of Israel (19:41-43). Sheba, a Benjamite, headed a revolt of the men of Israel. He was pursued to Abelbeth-maachah, and was there put to death, and so the revolt came to an end.\n\n The end. After the suppression of the rebellion of Absalom and that of Sheba, ten comparatively peaceful years of David\u2019s life passed away. During those years he seems to have been principally engaged in accumulating treasures of every kind for the great temple at Jerusalem, which it was reserved to his successor to build ([1 Chr. 22](/1chr#1Chr.22); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28); [29](/1chr#1Chr.29)), a house which was to be \u201cexceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries\u201d (22:5). The exciting and laborious life he had spent, and the dangers and trials through which he had passed, had left him an enfeebled man, prematurely old. It became apparent that his life was now drawing to its close. A new palace conspiracy broke out as to who should be his successor. Joab favoured Adonijah. The chiefs of his party met at the \u201cFuller\u2019s spring,\u201d in the valley of Kidron, to proclaim him king; but Nathan hastened on a decision on the part of David in favour of Solomon, and so the aim of Adonijah\u2019s party failed. Solomon was brought to Jerusalem, and was anointed king and seated on his father\u2019s throne ([1 Kings 1:11-53](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.11)). David\u2019s last words are a grand utterance, revealing his unfailing faith in God, and his joyful confidence in his gracious covenant promises ([2 Sam. 23:1-7](/2sam#2Sam.23.1)).\n\n After a reign of forty years and six months ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5); [1 Chr. 3:4](/1chr#1Chr.3.4)) David died (B.C. 1015) at the age of seventy years, \u201cand was buried in the city of David.\u201d His tomb is still pointed out on Mount Zion.\n\n Both in his prophetical and in his regal character David was a type of the Messiah ([1 Sam. 16:13](/1sam#1Sam.16.13)). The book of Psalms commonly bears the title of the \u201cPsalms of David,\u201d from the circumstance that he was the largest contributor (about eighty psalms) to the collection. (See PSALMS.)\n\n \u201cThe greatness of David was felt when he was gone. He had lived in harmony with both the priesthood and the prophets; a sure sign that the spirit of his government had been throughly loyal to the higher aims of the theocracy. The nation had not been oppressed by him, but had been left in the free enjoyment of its ancient liberties. As far as his power went he had striven to act justly to all ([2 Sam. 8:15](/2sam#2Sam.8.15)). His weak indulgence to his sons, and his own great sin besides, had been bitterly atoned, and were forgotten at his death in the remembrance of his long-tried worth. He had reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem and seven and a half at Hebron ([2 Sam. 5:5](/2sam#2Sam.5.5)). Israel at his accession had reached the lowest point of national depression; its new-born unity rudely dissolved; its territory assailed by the Philistines. But he had left it an imperial power, with dominions like those of Egypt or Assyria. The sceptre of Solomon was already, before his father\u2019s death, owned from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates, and from the Orontes to the Red Sea.\u201d, Geikie\u2019s Hours etc., iii.",

They were divided into several branches, speaking different dialects of the same agglutinative language. The race to which they belonged was brachycephalic, or short-headed, like the pre-Semitic Sumerians of Babylonia.\n\n \u201cThe earliest Elamite kingdom seems to have been that of Anzan, the exact site of which is uncertain; but in the time of Abraham, Shushan or Susa appears to have already become the capital of the country. Babylonia was frequently invaded by the Elamite kings, who at times asserted their supremacy over it (as in the case of Chedorlaomer, the Kudur-Lagamar, or \u2018servant of the goddess Lagamar,\u2019 of the cuneiform texts).\n\n \u201cThe later Assyrian monarchs made several campaigns against Elam, and finally Assur-bani-pal (about B.C. 650) succeeded in conquering the country, which was ravaged with fire and sword.

He was the first of the line of Ithamar, Aaron\u2019s fourth son ([1 Chr. 24:3](/1chr#1Chr.24.3); comp. [2 Sam. 8:17](/2sam#2Sam.8.17)), who held that office. The office remained in his family till the time of Abiathar ([1 Kings 2:26](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.26), [27](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.27)), whom Solomon deposed, and appointed Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, in his stead (35). He acted also as a civil judge in Israel after the death of Samson ([1 Sam. 4:18](/1sam#1Sam.4.18)), and judged Israel for forty years.\n\n His sons Hophni and Phinehas grossly misconducted themselves, to the great disgust of the people ([1 Sam. 2:27-36](/1sam#1Sam.2.27)). They were licentious reprobates. He failed to reprove them so sternly as he ought to have done, and so brought upon his house the judgment of God (2:22-33; 3:18). The Israelites proclaimed war against the Philistines, whose army was encamped at Aphek. The battle, fought a short way beyond Mizpeh, ended in the total defeat of Israel. Four thousand of them fell in \u201cbattle array\u201d. They now sought safety in having the \u201cark of the covenant of the Lord\u201d among them. They fetched it from Shiloh, and Hophni and Phinehas accompanied it. This was the first time since the settlement of Israel in Canaan that the ark had been removed from the sanctuary. The Philistines put themselves again in array against Israel, and in the battle which ensued \u201cIsrael was smitten, and there was a very great slaughter.\u201d The tidings of this great disaster were speedily conveyed to Shiloh, about 20 miles distant, by a messenger, a Benjamite from the army. There Eli sat outside the gate of the sanctuary by the wayside, anxiously waiting for tidings from the battle-field. The full extent of the national calamity was speedily made known to him: \u201cIsrael is fled before the Philistines, there has also been a great slaughter among the people, thy two sons Hophni and Phinehas are dead, and the ark of God is taken\u201d ([1 Sam. 4:12-18](/1sam#1Sam.4.12)). When the old man, whose eyes were \u201cstiffened\u201d (i.e., fixed, as of a blind eye unaffected by the light) with age, heard this sad story of woe, he fell backward from off his seat and died, being ninety and eight years old. (See ITHAMAR.)\n\n Eli, Heb. eli, \u201cmy God\u201d, ([Matt. 27:46](/matt#Matt.27.46)), an exclamation used by Christ on the cross.

[Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17), [18](/gal#Gal.1.18)) Elijah met Obadiah, one of Ahab\u2019s officers, whom he had sent out to seek for pasturage for the cattle, and bade him go and tell his master that Elijah was there. The king came and met Elijah, and reproached him as the troubler of Israel. It was then proposed that sacrifices should be publicly offered, for the purpose of determining whether Baal or Jehovah were the true God. This was done on Carmel, with the result that the people fell on their faces, crying, \u201cThe Lord, he is the God.\u201d Thus was accomplished the great work of Elijah\u2019s ministry. The prophets of Baal were then put to death by the order of Elijah. Not one of them escaped. Then immediately followed rain, according to the word of Elijah, and in answer to his prayer ([James 5:18](/jas#Jas.5.18)).\n\n Jezebel, enraged at the fate that had befallen her priests of Baal, threatened to put Elijah to death ([1 Kings 19:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.1)). He therefore fled in alarm to Beersheba, and thence went alone a day\u2019s journey into the wilderness, and sat down in despondency under a juniper tree. As he slept an angel touched him, and said unto him, \u201cArise and eat; because the journey is too great for thee.\u201d He arose and found a cake and a cruse of water. Having partaken of the provision thus miraculously supplied, he went forward on his solitary way for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God, where he took up his abode in a cave. Here the Lord appeared unto him and said, \u201cWhat dost thou here, Elijah?\u201d In answer to his despondent words God manifests to him his glory, and then directs him to return to Damascus and anoint Hazael king over Syria, and Jehu king over Israel, and Elisha to be prophet in his room ([1 Kings 19:13-21](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.13); comp. [2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7); [9:1-10](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.1)).\n\n Some six years after this he warned Ahab and Jezebel of the violent deaths they would die ([1 Kings 21:19-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19); [22:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.38)). He also, four years afterwards, warned Ahaziah (q.v.), who had succeeded his father Ahab, of his approaching death ([2 Kings 1:1-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.1)). (See NABOTH.) During these intervals he probably withdrew to some quiet retirement, no one knew where. His interview with Ahaziah\u2019s messengers on the way to Ekron, and the account of the destruction of his captains with their fifties, suggest the idea that he may have been in retirement at this time on Mount Carmel.\n\n The time now drew near when he was to be taken up into heaven ([2 Kings 2:1-12](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.1)). He had a presentiment of what was awaiting him. He went down to Gilgal, where was a school of the prophets, and where his successor Elisha, whom he had anointed some years before, resided. Elisha was solemnized by the thought of his master\u2019s leaving him, and refused to be parted from him. \u201cThey two went on,\u201d and came to Bethel and Jericho, and crossed the Jordan, the waters of which were \u201cdivided hither and thither\u201d when smitten with Elijah\u2019s mantle. Arrived at the borders of Gilead, which Elijah had left many years before, it \u201ccame to pass as they still went on and talked\u201d they were suddenly separated by a chariot and horses of fire; and \u201cElijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven, \u201cElisha receiving his mantle, which fell from him as he ascended.\n\n No one of the old prophets is so frequently referred to in the New Testament. The priests and Levites said to the Baptist ([John 1:25](/john#John.1.25)), \u201cWhy baptizest thou, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias?\u201d Paul ([Rom. 11:2](/rom#Rom.11.2)) refers to an incident in his history to illustrate his argument that God had not cast away his people. James (5:17) finds in him an illustration of the power of prayer. (See also [Luke 4:25](/luke#Luke.4.25); [9:54](/luke#Luke.9.54).) He was a type of John the Baptist in the sternness and power of his reproofs ([Luke 9:8](/luke#Luke.9.8)). He was the Elijah that \u201cmust first come\u201d ([Matt. 11:11](/matt#Matt.11.11), [14](/matt#Matt.11.14)), the forerunner of our Lord announced by Malachi. Even outwardly the Baptist corresponded so closely to the earlier prophet that he might be styled a second Elijah. In him we see \u201cthe same connection with a wild and wilderness country; the same long retirement in the desert; the same sudden, startling entrance on his work ([1 Kings 17:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.17.1); [Luke 3:2](/luke#Luke.3.2)); even the same dress, a hairy garment, and a leathern girdle about the loins ([2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8); [Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4)).\u201d\n\n How deep the impression was which Elijah made \u201con the mind of the nation may be judged from the fixed belief, which rested on the words of Malachi (4:5, 6), which many centuries after prevailed that he would again appear for the relief and restoration of the country. Each remarkable person as he arrives on the scene, be his habits and characteristics what they may, the stern John equally with his gentle Successor, is proclaimed to be Elijah ([Matt. 11:13](/matt#Matt.11.13), [14](/matt#Matt.11.14); 16:14; 17:10; [Mark 9:11](/mark#Mark.9.11); [15:35](/mark#Mark.15.35); [Luke 9:7](/luke#Luke.9.7), [8](/luke#Luke.9.8); [John 1:21](/john#John.1.21)). His appearance in glory on the mount of transfiguration does not seem to have startled the disciples. They were \u2018sore afraid,\u2019 but not apparently surprised.\u201d",

His name first occurs in the command given to Elijah to anoint him as his successor ([1 Kings 19:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.19.16)). This was the only one of the three commands then given to Elijah which he accomplished. On his way from Sinai to Damascus he found Elisha at his native place engaged in the labours of the field, ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen. He went over to him, threw over his shoulders his rough mantle, and at once adopted him as a son, and invested him with the prophetical office (comp. [Luke 9:61](/luke#Luke.9.61), [62](/luke#Luke.9.62)). Elisha accepted the call thus given (about four years before the death of Ahab), and for some seven or eight years became the close attendant on Elijah till he was parted from him and taken up into heaven. During all these years we hear nothing of Elisha except in connection with the closing scenes of Elijah\u2019s life. After Elijah, Elisha was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets, and became noted in Israel. He possessed, according to his own request, \u201ca double portion\u201d of Elijah\u2019s spirit ([2 Kings 2:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.9)); and for the long period of about sixty years (B.C. 892-832) held the office of \u201cprophet in Israel\u201d ([2 Kings 5:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.5.8)).\n\n After Elijah\u2019s departure, Elisha returned to Jericho, and there healed the spring of water by casting salt into it ([2 Kings 2:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.2.21)). We next find him at Bethel (2:23), where, with the sternness of his master, he cursed the youths who came out and scoffed at him as a prophet of God: \u201cGo up, thou bald head.\u201d The judgment at once took effect, and God terribly visited the dishonour done to his prophet as dishonour done to himself. We next read of his predicting a fall of rain when the army of Jehoram was faint from thirst ([2 Kings 3:9-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.9)); of the multiplying of the poor widow\u2019s cruse of oil (4:1-7); the miracle of restoring to life the son of the woman of Shunem (4:18-37); the multiplication of the twenty loaves of new barley into a sufficient supply for an hundred men (4:42-44); of the cure of Naaman the Syrian of his leprosy (5:1-27); of the punishment of Gehazi for his falsehood and his covetousness; of the recovery of the axe lost in the waters of the Jordan (6:1-7); of the miracle at Dothan, half-way on the road between Samaria and Jezreel; of the siege of Samaria by the king of Syria, and of the terrible sufferings of the people in connection with it, and Elisha\u2019s prophecy as to the relief that would come ([2 Kings 6:24-7:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)).\n\n We then find Elisha at Damascus, to carry out the command given to his master to anoint Hazael king over Syria ([2 Kings 8:7-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.7)); thereafter he directs one of the sons of the prophets to anoint Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel, instead of Ahab. Thus the three commands given to Elijah (9:1-10) were at length carried out.\n\n We do not again read of him till we find him on his death-bed in his own house ([2 Kings 13:14-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.14)). Joash, the grandson of Jehu, comes to mourn over his approaching departure, and utters the same words as those of Elisha when Elijah was taken away: \u201cMy father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.\u201d\n\n Afterwards when a dead body is laid in Elisha\u2019s grave a year after his burial, no sooner does it touch the hallowed remains than the man \u201crevived, and stood up on his feet\u201d ([2 Kings 13:20-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.20)).",

The name of Edom, \u201cred\u201d, was also given to him from his conduct in connection with the red lentil \u201cpottage\u201d for which he sold his birthright (30, 31). The circumstances connected with his birth foreshadowed the enmity which afterwards subsisted between the twin brothers and the nations they founded (25:22, 23, 26). In process of time Jacob, following his natural bent, became a shepherd; while Esau, a \u201cson of the desert,\u201d devoted himself to the perilous and toilsome life of a huntsman. On a certain occasion, on returning from the chase, urged by the cravings of hunger, Esau sold his birthright to his brother, Jacob, who thereby obtained the covenant blessing ([Gen. 27:28](/gen#Gen.27.28), [29](/gen#Gen.27.29), [36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16), [17](/heb#Heb.12.17)). He afterwards tried to regain what he had so recklessly parted with, but was defeated in his attempts through the stealth of his brother ([Gen. 27:4](/gen#Gen.27.4), [34](/gen#Gen.27.34), [38](/gen#Gen.27.38)).\n\n At the age of forty years, to the great grief of his parents, he married ([Gen. 26:34](/gen#Gen.26.34), [35](/gen#Gen.26.35)) two Canaanitish maidens, Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Bashemath, the daughter of Elon. When Jacob was sent away to Padan-aram, Esau tried to conciliate his parents ([Gen. 28:8](/gen#Gen.28.8), [9](/gen#Gen.28.9)) by marrying his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael. This led him to cast in his lot with the Ishmaelite tribes; and driving the Horites out of Mount Seir, he settled in that region. After some thirty years\u2019 sojourn in Padan-aram Jacob returned to Canaan, and was reconciled to Esau, who went forth to meet him (33:4). Twenty years after this, Isaac their father died, when the two brothers met, probably for the last time, beside his grave (35:29). Esau now permanently left Canaan, and established himself as a powerful and wealthy chief in the land of Edom (q.v.).\n\n Long after this, when the descendants of Jacob came out of Egypt, the Edomites remembered the old quarrel between the brothers, and with fierce hatred they warred against Israel.",

She was a Jewess named Hadas\u2019sah (the myrtle), but when she entered the royal harem she received the name by which she henceforth became known ([Esther 2:7](/esth#Esth.2.7)). It is a Syro-Arabian modification of the Persian word satarah, which means a star. She was the daughter of Abihail, a Benjamite. Her family did not avail themselves of the permission granted by Cyrus to the exiles to return to Jerusalem; and she resided with her cousin Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king at \u201cShushan in the palace.\u201d Ahasuerus having divorced Vashti, chose Esther to be his wife. Soon after this he gave Haman the Agagite, his prime minister, power and authority to kill and extirpate all the Jews throughout the Persian empire. By the interposition of Esther this terrible catastrophe was averted. Haman was hanged on the gallows he had intended for Mordecai ([Esther 7](/esth#Esth.7)); and the Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim (q.v.), in memory of their wonderful deliverance. This took place about fifty-two years after the Return, the year of the great battles of Plataea and Mycale (B.C. 479).\n\n Esther appears in the Bible as a \u201cwoman of deep piety, faith, courage, patriotism, and caution, combined with resolution; a dutiful daughter to her adopted father, docile and obedient to his counsels, and anxious to share the king\u2019s favour with him for the good of the Jewish people. There must have been a singular grace and charm in her aspect and manners, since \u2018she obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her\u2019 ([Esther 2:15](/esth#Esth.2.15)). That she was raised up as an instrument in the hand of God to avert the destruction of the Jewish people, and to afford them protection and forward their wealth and peace in their captivity, is also manifest from the Scripture account.\u201d",

The Creator, by declaring that it was not good for man to be alone, and by creating for him a suitable companion, gave sanction to monogamy. The commentator Matthew Henry says: \u201cThis companion was taken from his side to signify that she was to be dear unto him as his own flesh. Not from his head, lest she should rule over him; nor from his feet, lest he should tyrannize over her; but from his side, to denote that species of equality which is to subsist in the marriage state.\u201d And again, \u201cThat wife that is of God\u2019s making by special grace, and of God\u2019s bringing by special providence, is likely to prove a helpmeet to her husband.\u201d Through the subtle temptation of the serpent she violated the commandment of God by taking of the forbidden fruit, which she gave also unto her husband ([1 Tim. 2:13-15](/1tim#1Tim.2.13); [2 Cor. 11:3](/2cor#2Cor.11.3)).

            "dictText": "The \u201cscribe\u201d who led the second body of exiles that returned from Babylon to Jerusalem B.C. 459, and author of the book of Scripture which bears his name. He was the son, or perhaps grandson, of Seraiah ([2 Kings 25:18-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.18)), and a lineal descendant of Phinehas, the son of Aaron ([Ezra 7:1-5](/ezra#Ezra.7.1)). All we know of his personal history is contained in the last four chapters of his book, and in [Neh. 8](/neh#Neh.8) and 12:26.\n\n In the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (see DARIUS), he obtained leave to go up to Jerusalem and to take with him a company of Israelites ([Ezra 8](/ezra#Ezra.8)). Artaxerxes manifested great interest in Ezra\u2019s undertaking, granting him \u201call his request,\u201d and loading him with gifts for the house of God. Ezra assembled the band of exiles, probably about 5,000 in all, who were prepared to go up with him to Jerusalem, on the banks of the Ahava, where they rested for three days, and were put into order for their march across the desert, which was completed in four months. His proceedings at Jerusalem on his arrival there are recorded in his book.\n\n He was \u201ca ready scribe in the law of Moses,\u201d who \u201chad prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.\u201d \u201cHe is,\u201d says Professor Binnie, \u201cthe first well-defined example of an order of men who have never since ceased in the church; men of sacred erudition, who devote their lives to the study of the Holy Scriptures, in order that they may be in a condition to interpret them for the instruction and edification of the church. It is significant that the earliest mention of the pulpit occurs in the history of Ezra\u2019s ministry ([Neh. 8:4](/neh#Neh.8.4)). He was much more of a teacher than a priest. We learn from the account of his labours in the book of Nehemiah that he was careful to have the whole people instructed in the law of Moses; and there is no reason to reject the constant tradition of the Jews which connects his name with the collecting and editing of the Old Testament canon. The final completion of the canon may have been, and probably was, the work of a later generation; but Ezra seems to have put it much into the shape in which it is still found in the Hebrew Bible. When it is added that the complete organization of the synagogue dates from this period, it will be seen that the age was emphatically one of Biblical study\u201d (The Psalms: their History, etc.).\n\n For about fourteen years, i.e., till B.C. 445, we have no record of what went on in Jerusalem after Ezra had set in order the ecclesiastical and civil affairs of the nation. In that year another distinguished personage, Nehemiah, appears on the scene. After the ruined wall of the city had been built by Nehemiah, there was a great gathering of the people at Jerusalem preparatory to the dedication of the wall. On the appointed day the whole population assembled, and the law was read aloud to them by Ezra and his assistants ([Neh. 8:3](/neh#Neh.8.3)). The remarkable scene is described in detail. There was a great religious awakening. For successive days they held solemn assemblies, confessing their sins and offering up solemn sacrifices. They kept also the feast of Tabernacles with great solemnity and joyous enthusiasm, and then renewed their national covenant to be the Lord\u2019s. Abuses were rectified, and arrangements for the temple service completed, and now nothing remained but the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12)).",

He was of the family of Abiezer ([Josh. 17:2](/josh#Josh.17.2); [1 Chr. 7:18](/1chr#1Chr.7.18)), and of the little township of Ophrah ([Judg. 6:11](/judg#Judg.6.11)). First, with ten of his servants, he overthrew the altars of Baal and cut down the asherah which was upon it, and then blew the trumpet of alarm, and the people flocked to his standard on the crest of Mount Gilboa to the number of twenty-two thousand men. These were, however, reduced to only three hundred. These, strangely armed with torches and pitchers and trumpets, rushed in from three different points on the camp of Midian at midnight, in the valley to the north of Moreh, with the terrible war-cry, \u201cFor the Lord and for Gideon\u201d ([Judg. 7:18](/judg#Judg.7.18), R.V.). Terror-stricken, the Midianites were put into dire confusion, and in the darkness slew one another, so that only fifteen thousand out of the great army of one hundred and twenty thousand escaped alive. The memory of this great deliverance impressed itself deeply on the mind of the nation ([1 Sam. 12:11](/1sam#1Sam.12.11); [Ps. 83:11](/ps#Ps.83.11); [Isa. 9:4](/isa#Isa.9.4); [10:26](/isa#Isa.10.26); [Heb. 11:32](/heb#Heb.11.32)). The land had now rest for forty years. Gideon died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of his fathers. Soon after his death a change came over the people. They again forgot Jehovah, and turned to the worship of Baalim, \u201cneither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal\u201d ([Judg. 8:35](/judg#Judg.8.35)). Gideon left behind him seventy sons, a feeble, sadly degenerated race, with one exception, that of Abimelech, who seems to have had much of the courage and energy of his father, yet of restless and unscrupulous ambition. He gathered around him a band who slaughtered all Gideon\u2019s sons, except Jotham, upon one stone. (See OPHRAH.)",

In the battle which was fought the Syrians were scattered, and the Ammonites in alarm fled into their capital. After this Hadadezer went north \u201cto recover his border\u201d ([2 Sam. 8:3](/2sam#2Sam.8.3), A.V.); but rather, as the Revised Version renders, \u201cto recover his dominion\u201d, i.e., to recruit his forces.

Shobach, the leader of the Syrian army, died on the field of battle. The Syrians of Damascus, who had come to help Hadadezer, were also routed, and Damascus was made tributary to David.

When she was about to become a mother she fled from the cruelty of her mistress, intending apparently to return to her relatives in Egypt, through the desert of Shur, which lay between. Wearied and worn she had reached the place she distinguished by the name of Beer-lahai-roi (\u201cthe well of the visible God\u201d), where the angel of the Lord appeared to her. In obedience to the heavenly visitor she returned to the tent of Abraham, where her son Ishmael was born, and where she remained (16) till after the birth of Isaac, the space of fourteen years. Sarah after this began to vent her dissatisfaction both on Hagar and her child. Ishmael\u2019s conduct was insulting to Sarah, and she insisted that he and his mother should be dismissed. This was accordingly done, although with reluctance on the part of Abraham ([Gen. 21:14](/gen#Gen.21.14)). They wandered out into the wilderness, where Ishmael, exhausted with his journey and faint from thirst, seemed about to die. Hagar \u201clifted up her voice and wept,\u201d and the angel of the Lord, as before, appeared unto her, and she was comforted and delivered out of her distresses ([Gen. 21:18](/gen#Gen.21.18), [19](/gen#Gen.21.19)).\n\n Ishmael afterwards established himself in the wilderness of Paran, where he married an Egyptian ([Gen. 21:20](/gen#Gen.21.20), [21](/gen#Gen.21.21)).\n\n \u201cHagar\u201d allegorically represents the Jewish church ([Gal. 4:24](/gal#Gal.4.24)), in bondage to the ceremonial law; while \u201cSarah\u201d represents the Christian church, which is free.",

He was the first of the three (Zechariah, his contemporary, and Malachi, who was about one hundred years later, being the other two) whose ministry belonged to the period of Jewish history which began after the return from captivity in Babylon. Scarcely anything is known of his personal history. He may have been one of the captives taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar. He began his ministry about sixteen years after the Return. The work of rebuilding the temple had been put a stop to through the intrigues of the Samaritans. After having been suspended for fifteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah ([Ezra 6:14](/ezra#Ezra.6.14)), who by their exhortations roused the people from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of the favourable opportunity that had arisen in a change in the policy of the Persian government. (See  DARIUS [2].) Haggai\u2019s prophecies have thus been characterized:, \u201cThere is a ponderous and simple dignity in the emphatic reiteration addressed alike to every class of the community, prince, priest, and people, \u2018Be strong, be strong, be strong\u2019 (2:4). \u2018Cleave, stick fast, to the work you have to do;\u2019 or again, \u2018Consider your ways, consider, consider, consider\u2019 (1:5, 7;2:15, 18). It is the Hebrew phrase for the endeavour, characteristic of the gifted seers of all times, to compel their hearers to turn the inside of their hearts outwards to their own view, to take the mask from off their consciences, to \u2018see life steadily, and to see it wholly.\u2019\u201d, Stanley\u2019s Jewish Church.

            "dictText": "Favour, grace, one of the wives of Elkanah the Levite, and the mother of Samuel ([1 Sam. 1](/1sam#1Sam.1); [2](/1sam#1Sam.2)). Her home was at Ramathaim-zophim, whence she was wont every year to go to Shiloh, where the tabernacle had been pitched by Joshua, to attend the offering of sacrifices there according to the law ([Ex. 23:15](/exod#Exod.23.15); [34:18](/exod#Exod.34.18); [Deut. 16:16](/deut#Deut.16.16)), probably at the feast of the Passover (comp. [Ex. 13:10](/exod#Exod.13.10)). On occasion of one of these \u201cyearly\u201d visits, being grieved by reason of Peninnah\u2019s conduct toward her, she went forth alone, and kneeling before the Lord at the sanctuary she prayed inaudibly. Eli the high priest, who sat at the entrance to the holy place, observed her, and misunderstanding her character he harshly condemned her conduct ([1 Sam. 1:14-16](/1sam#1Sam.1.14)). After hearing her explanation he retracted his injurious charge and said to her, \u201cGo in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition.\u201d Perhaps the story of the wife of Manoah was not unknown to her. Thereafter Elkanah and his family retired to their quiet home, and there, before another Passover, Hannah gave birth to a son, whom, in grateful memory of the Lord\u2019s goodness, she called Samuel, i.e., \u201cheard of God.\u201d After the child was weaned (probably in his third year) she brought him to Shiloh into the house of the Lord, and said to Eli the aged priest, \u201cOh my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the Lord. For this child I prayed; and the Lord hath given me my petition which I asked of him: therefore I also have granted him to the Lord; as long as he liveth he is granted to the Lord\u201d ([1 Sam. 1:27](/1sam#1Sam.1.27), [28](/1sam#1Sam.1.28), R.V.). Her gladness of heart then found vent in that remarkable prophetic song (2:1-10; comp. [Luke 1:46-55](/luke#Luke.1.46)) which contains the first designation of the Messiah under that name ([1 Sam. 2:10](/1sam#1Sam.2.10), \u201cAnnointed\u201d = \u201cMessiah\u201d). And so Samuel and his parents parted. He was left at Shiloh to minister \u201cbefore the Lord.\u201d And each year, when they came up to Shiloh, Hannah brought to her absent child \u201ca little coat\u201d (Heb. meil, a term used to denote the \u201crobe\u201d of the ephod worn by the high priest, [Ex. 28:31](/exod#Exod.28.31)), a priestly robe, a long upper tunic ([1 Chr. 15:27](/1chr#1Chr.15.27)), in which to minister in the tabernacle ([1 Sam. 2:19](/1sam#1Sam.2.19); [15:27](/1sam#1Sam.15.27); [Job 2:12](/job#Job.2.12)). \u201cAnd the child Samuel grew before the Lord.\u201d After Samuel, Hannah had three sons and two daughters.",

Voices here and there from the crowd exclaimed that it was the apparition of something divine. And when he spoke and made an oration to them, they gave a shout, saying, \u2019It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.\u2019 But in the midst of this idolatrous ostentation an angel of God suddenly smote him. He was carried out of the theatre a dying man.\u201d He died (A.D. 44) of the same loathsome malady which slew his grandfather ([Acts. 12:21-23](/acts#Acts.12.21)), in the fifty-fourth year of his age, having reigned four years as tetrarch and three as king over the whole of Palestine. After his death his kingdom came under the control of the prefect of Syria, and Palestine was now fully incorporated with the empire.",

He reigned twenty-nine years (B.C. 726-697). The history of this king is contained in [2 Kings 18:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20), [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)-39, and [2 Chr. 29](/2chr#2Chr.29)-32. He is spoken of as a great and good king. In public life he followed the example of his great-granfather Uzziah. He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom, and among other things which he did for this end, he destroyed the \u201cbrazen serpent,\u201d which had been removed to Jerusalem, and had become an object of idolatrous worship ([Num. 21:9](/num#Num.21.9)). A great reformation was wrought in the kingdom of Judah in his day ([2 Kings 18:4](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.4); [2 Chr. 29:3-36](/2chr#2Chr.29.3)).\n\n On the death of Sargon and the accession of his son Sennacherib to the throne of Assyria, Hezekiah refused to pay the tribute which his father had paid, and \u201crebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him not,\u201d but entered into a league with Egypt ([Isa. 30](/isa#Isa.30); [31](/isa#Isa.31); [36:6-9](/isa#Isa.36.6)). This led to the invasion of Judah by Sennacherib ([2 Kings 18:13-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13)), who took forty cities, and besieged Jerusalem with mounds. Hezekiah yielded to the demands of the Assyrian king, and agreed to pay him three hundred talents of silver and thirty of gold (18:14).\n\n But Sennacherib dealt treacherously with Hezekiah ([Isa. 33:1](/isa#Isa.33.1)), and a second time within two years invaded his kingdom ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17); [2 Chr. 32:9](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36](/isa#Isa.36)). This invasion issued in the destruction of Sennacherib\u2019s army. Hezekiah prayed to God, and \u201cthat night the angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians 185,000 men.\u201d Sennacherib fled with the shattered remnant of his forces to Nineveh, where, seventeen years after, he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer ([2 Kings 19:37](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.37)). (See SENNACHERIB.)\n\n The narrative of Hezekiah\u2019s sickness and miraculous recovery is found in [2 Kings 20:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.1), [2](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.2) Chr. 32:24, [Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1). Various ambassadors came to congratulate him on his recovery, and among them Merodach-baladan, the viceroy of Babylon ([2 Chr. 32:23](/2chr#2Chr.32.23); [2 Kings 20:12](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)). He closed his days in peace and prosperity, and was succeeded by his son Manasseh. He was buried in the \u201cchiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David\u201d ([2 Chr. 32:27-33](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)). He had \u201cafter him none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him\u201d ([2 Kings 18:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.5)). (See ISAIAH.)",

To him and his deputy ([2 Kings 23:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.5)), along with the ordinary priests and the Levites who had charge of the gates, was entrusted the purification of the temple in Jerusalem. While this was in progress, he discovered in some hidden corner of the building a book called the \u201cbook of the law\u201d ([2 Kings 22:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.8)) and the \u201cbook of the covenant\u201d (23:2). Some have supposed that this \u201cbook\u201d was nothing else than the original autograph copy of the Pentateuch written by Moses ([Deut. 31:9-26](/deut#Deut.31.9)). This remarkable discovery occurred in the eighteenth year of Josiah\u2019s reign (B.C. 624), a discovery which permanently affected the whole subsequent history of Israel. (See JOSIAH; SHAPHAN.)",

He was circumcised when eight days old (4-7); and when he was probably two years old a great feast was held in connection with his being weaned.\n\n The next memorable event in his life is that connected with the command of God given to Abraham to offer him up as a sacrifice on a mountain in the land of Moriah ([Gen. 22](/gen#Gen.22)). (See ABRAHAM.) When he was forty years of age Rebekah was chosen for his wife ([Gen. 24](/gen#Gen.24)). After the death and burial of his father he took up his residence at Beer-lahai-roi (25:7-11), where his two sons, Esau and Jacob, were born (21-26), the former of whom seems to have been his favourite son (27, 28).\n\n In consequence of a famine ([Gen. 26:1](/gen#Gen.26.1)) Isaac went to Gerar, where he practised deception as to his relation to Rebekah, imitating the conduct of his father in Egypt (12:12-20) and in Gerar (20:2). The Philistine king rebuked him for his prevarication.\n\n After sojourning for some time in the land of the Philistines, he returned to Beersheba, where God gave him fresh assurance of covenant blessing, and where Abimelech entered into a covenant of peace with him.\n\n The next chief event in his life was the blessing of his sons ([Gen. 27:1](/gen#Gen.27.1)). He died at Mamre, \u201cbeing old and full of days\u201d (35:27-29), one hundred and eighty years old, and was buried in the cave of Machpelah.\n\n In the New Testament reference is made to his having been \u201coffered up\u201d by his father ([Heb. 11:17](/heb#Heb.11.17); [James 2:21](/jas#Jas.2.21)), and to his blessing his sons ([Heb. 11:20](/heb#Heb.11.20)). As the child of promise, he is contrasted with Ishmael ([Rom. 9:7](/rom#Rom.9.7), [10](/rom#Rom.9.10); [Gal. 4:28](/gal#Gal.4.28); [Heb. 11:18](/heb#Heb.11.18)).\n\n Isaac is \u201cat once a counterpart of his father in simple devoutness and purity of life, and a contrast in his passive weakness of character, which in part, at least, may have sprung from his relations to his mother and wife. After the expulsion of Ishmael and Hagar, Isaac had no competitor, and grew up in the shade of Sarah\u2019s tent, moulded into feminine softness by habitual submission to her strong, loving will.\u201d His life was so quiet and uneventful that it was spent \u201cwithin the circle of a few miles; so guileless that he let Jacob overreach him rather than disbelieve his assurance; so tender that his mother\u2019s death was the poignant sorrow of years; so patient and gentle that peace with his neighbours was dearer than even such a coveted possession as a well of living water dug by his own men; so grandly obedient that he put his life at his father\u2019s disposal; so firm in his reliance on God that his greatest concern through life was to honour the divine promise given to his race.\u201d, Geikie\u2019s Hours, etc.",

His wife was called \u201cthe prophetess\u201d (8:3), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like Deborah ([Judg. 4:4](/judg#Judg.4.4)) and Huldah ([2 Kings 22:14-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.14)), or simply because she was the wife of \u201cthe prophet\u201d ([Isa. 38:1](/isa#Isa.38.1)). He had two sons, who bore symbolical names.\n\n He exercised the functions of his office during the reigns of Uzziah (or Azariah), Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (1:1). Uzziah reigned fifty-two years (B.C. 810-759), and Isaiah must have begun his career a few years before Uzziah\u2019s death, probably B.C. 762. He lived till the fourteenth year of Hezekiah, and in all likelihood outlived that monarch (who died B.C. 698), and may have been contemporary for some years with Manasseh. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for the long period of at least sixty-four years.\n\n His first call to the prophetical office is not recorded. A second call came to him \u201cin the year that King Uzziah died\u201d ([Isa. 6:1](/isa#Isa.6.1)). He exercised his ministry in a spirit of uncompromising firmness and boldness in regard to all that bore on the interests of religion. He conceals nothing and keeps nothing back from fear of man. He was also noted for his spirituality and for his deep-toned reverence toward \u201cthe holy One of Israel.\u201d\n\n In early youth Isaiah must have been moved by the invasion of Israel by the Assyrian monarch Pul (q.v.), [2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19); and again, twenty years later, when he had already entered on his office, by the invasion of Tiglath-pileser and his career of conquest. Ahaz, king of Judah, at this crisis refused to co-operate with the kings of Israel and Syria in opposition to the Assyrians, and was on that account attacked and defeated by Rezin of Damascus and Pekah of Samaria ([2 Kings 16:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.5); [2 Chr. 28:5](/2chr#2Chr.28.5), [6](/2chr#2Chr.28.6)). Ahaz, thus humbled, sided with Assyria, and sought the aid of Tiglath-pileser against Israel and Syria. The consequence was that Rezin and Pekah were conquered and many of the people carried captive to Assyria ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29); [16:9](/2kgs#2Kgs.16.9); [1 Chr. 5:26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). Soon after this Shalmaneser determined wholly to subdue the kingdom of Israel. Samaria was taken and destroyed (B.C. 722). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was unmolested by the Assyrian power; but on his accession to the throne, Hezekiah (B.C. 726), who \u201crebelled against the king of Assyria\u201d ([2 Kings 18:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.7)), in which he was encouraged by Isaiah, who exhorted the people to place all their dependence on Jehovah ([Isa. 10:24](/isa#Isa.10.24); [37:6](/isa#Isa.37.6)), entered into an alliance with the king of Egypt ([Isa. 30:2-4](/isa#Isa.30.2)). This led the king of Assyria to threaten the king of Judah, and at length to invade the land. Sennacherib (B.C. 701) led a powerful army into Palestine. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ([2 Kings 18:14-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.14)). But after a brief interval war broke out again, and again Sennacherib (q.v.) led an army into Palestine, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ([Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2); [37:8](/isa#Isa.37.8)). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians (37:1-7), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \u201cspread before the Lord\u201d (37:14). The judgement of God now fell on the Assyrian host. \u201cLike Xerxes in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah. He made no more expeditions against either Southern Palestine or Egypt.\u201d The remaining years of Hezekiah\u2019s reign were peaceful ([2 Chr. 32:23](/2chr#2Chr.32.23), [27](/2chr#2Chr.32.27)-29). Isaiah probably lived to its close, and possibly into the reign of Manasseh, but the time and manner of his death are unknown. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom in the heathen reaction in the time of Manasseh (q.v.).",

He grew up a true child of the desert, wild and wayward. On the occasion of the weaning of Isaac his rude and wayward spirit broke out in expressions of insult and mockery (21:9, 10); and Sarah, discovering this, said to Abraham, \u201cExpel this slave and her son.\u201d Influenced by a divine admonition, Abraham dismissed Hagar and her son with no more than a skin of water and some bread.

Of the after events of his life but little is known. He died at the age of one hundred and thirty-seven years, but where and when are unknown (25:17).

            "dictText": "One who follows on another\u2019s heels; supplanter, ([Gen. 25:26](/gen#Gen.25.26); [27:36](/gen#Gen.27.36); [Hos. 12:2-4](/hos#Hos.12.2)), the second born of the twin sons of Isaac by Rebekah. He was born probably at Lahai-roi, when his father was fifty-nine and Abraham one hundred and fifty-nine years old. Like his father, he was of a quiet and gentle disposition, and when he grew up followed the life of a shepherd, while his brother Esau became an enterprising hunter. His dealing with Esau, however, showed much mean selfishness and cunning ([Gen. 25:29-34](/gen#Gen.25.29)).\n\n When Isaac was about 160 years of age, Jacob and his mother conspired to deceive the aged patriarch ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), with the view of procuring the transfer of the birthright to himself. The birthright secured to him who possessed it (1) superior rank in his family ([Gen. 49:3](/gen#Gen.49.3)); (2) a double portion of the paternal inheritance ([Deut. 21:17](/deut#Deut.21.17)); (3) the priestly office in the family ([Num. 8:17-19](/num#Num.8.17)); and (4) the promise of the Seed in which all nations of the earth were to be blessed ([Gen. 22:18](/gen#Gen.22.18)).\n\n Soon after his acquisition of his father\u2019s blessing ([Gen. 27](/gen#Gen.27)), Jacob became conscious of his guilt; and afraid of the anger of Esau, at the suggestion of Rebekah Isaac sent him away to Haran, 400 miles or more, to find a wife among his cousins, the family of Laban, the Syrian (28). There he met with Rachel (29). Laban would not consent to give him his daughter in marriage till he had served seven years; but to Jacob these years \u201cseemed but a few days, for the love he had to her.\u201d But when the seven years were expired, Laban craftily deceived Jacob, and gave him his daughter Leah. Other seven years of service had to be completed probably before he obtained the beloved Rachel. But \u201clife-long sorrow, disgrace, and trials, in the retributive providence of God, followed as a consequence of this double union.\u201d\n\n At the close of the fourteen years of service, Jacob desired to return to his parents, but at the entreaty of Laban he tarried yet six years with him, tending his flocks (31:41). He then set out with his family and property \u201cto go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan\u201d ([Gen. 31](/gen#Gen.31)). Laban was angry when he heard that Jacob had set out on his journey, and pursued after him, overtaking him in seven days. The meeting was of a painful kind. After much recrimination and reproach directed against Jacob, Laban is at length pacified, and taking an affectionate farewell of his daughters, returns to his home in Padanaram. And now all connection of the Israelites with Mesopotamia is at an end.\n\n Soon after parting with Laban he is met by a company of angels, as if to greet him on his return and welcome him back to the Land of Promise (32:1, 2). He called the name of the place Mahanaim, i.e., \u201cthe double camp,\u201d probably his own camp and that of the angels. The vision of angels was the counterpart of that he had formerly seen at Bethel, when, twenty years before, the weary, solitary traveller, on his way to Padan-aram, saw the angels of God ascending and descending on the ladder whose top reached to heaven (28:12).\n\n He now hears with dismay of the approach of his brother Esau with a band of 400 men to meet him. In great agony of mind he prepares for the worst. He feels that he must now depend only on God, and he betakes himself to him in earnest prayer, and sends on before him a munificent present to Esau, \u201ca present to my lord Esau from thy servant Jacob.\u201d Jacob\u2019s family were then transported across the Jabbok; but he himself remained behind, spending the night in communion with God. While thus engaged, there appeared one in the form of a man who wrestled with him. In this mysterious contest Jacob prevailed, and as a memorial of it his name was changed to Israel (wrestler with God); and the place where this occured he called Peniel, \u201cfor\u201d, said he, \u201cI have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved\u201d (32:25-31).\n\n After this anxious night, Jacob went on his way, halting, mysteriously weakened by the conflict, but strong in the assurance of the divine favour. Esau came forth and met him; but his spirit of revenge was appeased, and the brothers met as friends, and during the remainder of their lives they maintained friendly relations. After a brief sojourn at Succoth, Jacob moved forward and pitched his tent near Shechem (q.v.), 33:18; but at length, under divine directions, he moved to Bethel, where he made an altar unto God (35:6, 7), and where God appeared to him and renewed the Abrahamic covenant. While journeying from Bethel to Ephrath (the Canaanitish name of Bethlehem), Rachel died in giving birth to her second son Benjamin (35:16-20), fifteen or sixteen years after the birth of Joseph. He then reached the old family residence at Mamre, to wait on the dying bed of his father Isaac. The complete reconciliation between Esau and Jacob was shown by their uniting in the burial of the patriarch (35:27-29).\n\n Jacob was soon after this deeply grieved by the loss of his beloved son Joseph through the jealousy of his brothers (37:33). Then follows the story of the famine, and the successive goings down into Egypt to buy corn (42), which led to the discovery of the long-lost Joseph, and the patriarch\u2019s going down with all his household, numbering about seventy souls ([Ex. 1:5](/exod#Exod.1.5); [Deut. 10:22](/deut#Deut.10.22); [Acts 7:14](/acts#Acts.7.14)), to sojourn in the land of Goshen. Here Jacob, \u201cafter being strangely tossed about on a very rough ocean, found at last a tranquil harbour, where all the best affections of his nature were gently exercised and largely unfolded\u201d ([Gen. 48](/gen#Gen.48)). At length the end of his checkered course draws nigh, and he summons his sons to his bedside that he may bless them. Among his last words he repeats the story of Rachel\u2019s death, although forty years had passed away since that event took place, as tenderly as if it had happened only yesterday; and when \u201che had made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost\u201d (49:33). His body was embalmed and carried with great pomp into the land of Canaan, and buried beside his wife Leah in the cave of Machpelah, according to his dying charge. There, probably, his embalmed body remains to this day (50:1-13). (See HEBRON.)\n\n The history of Jacob is referred to by the prophets Hosea (12:3, 4, 12) and Malachi (1:2). In [Micah 1:5](/mic#Mic.1.5) the name is a poetic synonym for Israel, the kingdom of the ten tribes. There are, besides the mention of his name along with those of the other patriarchs, distinct references to events of his life in Paul\u2019s epistles ([Rom. 9:11-13](/rom#Rom.9.11); [Heb. 12:16](/heb#Heb.12.16); [11:21](/heb#Heb.11.21)). See references to his vision at Bethel and his possession of land at Shechem in [John 1:51](/john#John.1.51); [4:5](/john#John.4.5), [12](/john#John.4.12); also to the famine which was the occasion of his going down into Egypt in [Acts 7:12](/acts#Acts.7.12) (See  LUZ; BETHEL.)",

He and his wife were two of the eight saved in the ark ([1 Pet. 3:20](/1pet#1Pet.3.20)). He was the progenitor of many tribes inhabiting the east of Europe and the north of Asia ([Gen. 10:2-5](/gen#Gen.10.2)). An act of filial piety (9:20-27) was the occasion of Noah\u2019s prophecy of the extension of his posterity.\n\n After the Flood the earth was re-peopled by the descendants of Noah, \u201cthe sons of Japheth\u201d ([Gen. 10:2](/gen#Gen.10.2)), \u201cthe sons of Ham\u201d (6), and \u201cthe sons of Shem\u201d (22). It is important to notice that modern ethnological science, reasoning from a careful analysis of facts, has arrived at the conclusion that there is a three-fold division of the human family, corresponding in a remarkable way with the great ethnological chapter of the book of Genesis (10). The three great races thus distinguished are called the Semitic, Aryan, and Turanian (Allophylian). \u201cSetting aside the cases where the ethnic names employed are of doubtful application, it cannot reasonably be questioned that the author [of [Gen. 10](/gen#Gen.10)] has in his account of the sons of Japheth classed together the Cymry or Celts (Gomer), the Medes (Madai), and the Ionians or Greeks (Javan), thereby anticipating what has become known in modern times as the \u2018Indo-European Theory,\u2019 or the essential unity of the Aryan (Asiatic) race with the principal races of Europe, indicated by the Celts and the Ionians. Nor can it be doubted that he has thrown together under the one head of \u2019children of Shem\u2019 the Assyrians (Asshur), the Syrians (Aram), the Hebrews (Eber), and the Joktanian Arabs (Joktan), four of the principal races which modern ethnology recognizes under the heading of \u2018Semitic.\u2019 Again, under the heading of \u2018sons of Ham,\u2019 the author has arranged \u2018Cush\u2019, i.e., the Ethiopians; \u2018Mizraim,\u2019 the people of Egypt; \u2018Sheba and Dedan,\u2019 or certain of the Southern Arabs; and \u2018Nimrod,\u2019 or the ancient people of Babylon, four races between which the latest linguistic researches have established a close affinity\u201d (Rawlinson\u2019s Hist.

While yet an infant, he was saved from the general massacre of the family by his aunt Jehosheba, and was apparently the only surviving descendant of Solomon ([2 Chr. 21:4](/2chr#2Chr.21.4), [17](/2chr#2Chr.21.17)). His uncle, the high priest Jehoiada, brought him forth to public notice when he was eight years of age, and crowned and anointed him king of Judah with the usual ceremonies. Athaliah was taken by surprise when she heard the shout of the people, \u201cLong live the king;\u201d and when she appeared in the temple, Jehoiada commanded her to be led forth to death ([2 Kings 11:13-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.11.13)). While the high priest lived, Jehoash favoured the worship of God and observed the law; but on his death he fell away into evil courses, and the land was defiled with idolatry. Zechariah, the son and successor of the high priest, was put to death. These evil deeds brought down on the land the judgement of God, and it was oppressed by the Syrian invaders. He is one of the three kings omitted by Matthew (1:8) in the genealogy of Christ, the other two being Ahaziah and Amaziah. He was buried in the city of David ([2 Kings 12:21](/2kgs#2Kgs.12.21)).

Palestine was now invaded and conquered by Nebuchadnezzar. Jehoiakim was taken prisoner and carried captive to Babylon ([2 Chr. 36:6](/2chr#2Chr.36.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.36.7)). It was at this time that Daniel also and his three companions were taken captive to Babylon ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2)).\n\n Nebuchadnezzar reinstated Jehoiakim on his throne, but treated him as a vassal king. In the year after this, Jeremiah caused his prophecies to be read by Baruch in the court of the temple. Jehoiakim, hearing of this, had them also read in the royal palace before himself. The words displeased him, and taking the roll from the hands of Baruch he cut it in pieces and threw it into the fire ([Jer. 36:23](/jer#Jer.36.23)). During his disastrous reign there was a return to the old idolatry and corruption of the days of Manasseh.\n\n After three years of subjection to Babylon, Jehoiakim withheld his tribute and threw off the yoke ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)), hoping to make himself independent. Nebuchadnezzar sent bands of Chaldeans, Syrians, and Ammonites ([2 Kings 24:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.2)) to chastise his rebellious vassal. They cruelly harassed the whole country (comp. [Jer. 49:1-6](/jer#Jer.49.1)). The king came to a violent death, and his body having been thrown over the wall of Jerusalem, to convince the beseieging army that he was dead, after having been dragged away, was buried beyond the gates of Jerusalem \u201cwith the burial of an ass,\u201d B.C. 599 ([Jer. 22:18](/jer#Jer.22.18), [19](/jer#Jer.22.19); 36:30).

He reigned twelve years, B.C. 896-884 ([2 Kings 1:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.17); [3:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.1)). His first work was to reduce to subjection the Moabites, who had asserted their independence in the reign of his brother. Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, assisted Jehoram in this effort. He was further helped by his ally the king of Edom. Elisha went forth with the confederated army ([2 Kings 3:1-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.1)), and at the solicitation of Jehoshaphat encouraged the army with the assurance from the Lord of a speedy victory. The Moabites under Mesha their king were utterly routed and their cities destroyed. At Kir-haraseth Mesha made a final stand. The Israelites refrained from pressing their victory further, and returned to their own land.\n\n Elisha afterwards again befriended Jehoram when a war broke out between the Syrians and Israel, and in a remarkable way brought that war to a bloodless close ([2 Kings 6:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.23)). But Jehoram, becoming confident in his own power, sank into idolatry, and brought upon himself and his land another Syrian invasion, which led to great suffering and distress in Samaria ([2 Kings 6:24-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.6.24)). By a remarkable providential interposition the city was saved from utter destruction, and the Syrians were put to flight ([2 Kings 7:6-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.7.6)).\n\n Jehoram was wounded in a battle with the Syrians at Ramah, and obliged to return to Jezreel ([2 Kings 8:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.29); [9:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.14), [15](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.15)), and soon after the army proclaimed their leader Jehu king of Israel, and revolted from their allegiance to Jehoram ([2 Kings 9](/2kgs#2Kgs.9)). Jehoram was pierced by an arrow from Jehu\u2019s bow on the piece of ground at Jezreel which Ahab had taken from Naboth, and there he died ([2 Kings 9:21-29](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.21)).",

After fortifying his kingdom against Israel ([2 Chr. 17:1](/2chr#2Chr.17.1), [2](/2chr#2Chr.17.2)), he set himself to cleanse the land of idolatry ([1 Kings 22:43](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.43)). In the third year of his reign he sent out priests and Levites over the land to instruct the people in the law ([2 Chr. 17:7-9](/2chr#2Chr.17.7)). He enjoyed a great measure of peace and prosperity, the blessing of God resting on the people \u201cin their basket and their store.\u201d\n\n The great mistake of his reign was his entering into an alliance with Ahab, the king of Israel, which involved him in much disgrace, and brought disaster on his kingdom ([1 Kings 22:1-33](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.1)). Escaping from the bloody battle of Ramoth-gilead, the prophet Jehu ([2 Chr. 19:1-3](/2chr#2Chr.19.1)) reproached him for the course he had been pursuing, whereupon he entered with rigour on his former course of opposition to all idolatry, and of deepening interest in the worship of God and in the righteous government of the people ([2 Chr. 19:4-11](/2chr#2Chr.19.4)).\n\n Again he entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the king of Israel, for the purpose of carrying on maritime commerce with Ophir. But the fleet that was then equipped at Ezion-gaber was speedily wrecked. A new fleet was fitted out without the co-operation of the king of Israel, and although it was successful, the trade was not prosecuted ([2 Chr. 20:35-37](/2chr#2Chr.20.35); [1 Kings 22:48-49](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.48)).\n\n He subsequently joined Jehoram, king of Israel, in a war against the Moabites, who were under tribute to Israel. This war was successful. The Moabites were subdued; but the dreadful act of Mesha in offering his own son a sacrifice on the walls of Kir-haresheth in the sight of the armies of Israel filled him with horror, and he withdrew and returned to his own land ([2 Kings 3:4-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.3.4)).\n\n The last most notable event of his reign was that recorded in [2 Chr. 20](/2chr#2Chr.20). The Moabites formed a great and powerful confederacy with the surrounding nations, and came against Jehoshaphat. The allied forces were encamped at Engedi. The king and his people were filled with alarm, and betook themselves to God in prayer. The king prayed in the court of the temple, \u201cO our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us.\u201d Amid the silence that followed, the voice of Jahaziel the Levite was heard announcing that on the morrow all this great host would be overthrown. So it was, for they quarrelled among themselves, and slew one another, leaving to the people of Judah only to gather the rich spoils of the slain. This was recognized as a great deliverance wrought for them by God (B.C. 890). Soon after this Jehoshaphat died, after a reign of twenty-five years, being sixty years of age, and was succeeded by his son Jehoram ([1 Kings 22:50](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.50)). He had this testimony, that \u201che sought the Lord with all his heart\u201d ([2 Chr. 22:9](/2chr#2Chr.22.9)). The kingdom of Judah was never more prosperous than under his reign.",

            "dictText": "King of Israel, the son of Jehoshaphat ([2 Kings 9:2](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.2)), and grandson of Nimshi. The story of his exaltation to the throne is deeply interesting. During the progress of a war against the Syrians, who were becoming more and more troublesome to Israel, in a battle at Ramoth-gilead Jehoram, the king of Israel, had been wounded; and leaving his army there, had returned to Jezreel, whither his ally, Ahaziah, king of Judah, had also gone on a visit of sympathy with him ([2 Kings 8:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.8.29)). The commanders, being left in charge of the conduct of the war, met in council; and while engaged in their deliberations, a messenger from Elisha appeared in the camp, and taking Jehu from the council, led him into a secret chamber, and there anointed him king over Israel, and immediately retired and disappeared ([2 Kings 9:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.6)). On being interrogated by his companions as to the object of this mysterious visitor, he informed them of what had been done, when immediately, with the utmost enthusiasm, they blew their trumpets and proclaimed him king ([2 Kings 9:11-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.11)). He then with a chosen band set forth with all speed to Jezreel, where, with his own hand, he slew Jehoram, shooting him through the heart with an arrow (9:24). The king of Judah, when trying to escape, was fatally wounded by one of Jehu\u2019s soldiers at Beth-gan. On entering the city, Jehu commanded the eunchs of the royal palace to cast down Jezebel into the street, where her mangled body was trodden under foot by the horses. Jehu was now master of Jezreel, whence he communicated with the persons in authority in Samaria the capital, commanding them to appear before him on the morrow with the heads of all the royal princes of Samaria. Accordingly on the morrow seventy heads were piled up in two heaps at his gate. At \u201cthe shearing-house\u201d ([2 Kings 10:12-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.12)) other forty-two connected with the house of Ahab were put to death ([2 Kings 10:14](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.14)). As Jehu rode on toward Samaria, he met Jehonadab (q.v.), whom he took into his chariot, and they entered the capital together. By a cunning stratagem he cut off all the worshippers of Baal found in Samaria ([2 Kings 10:19-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.19)), and destroyed the temple of the idol ([2 Kings 10:27](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.27)).\n\n Notwithstanding all this apparent zeal for the worship of Jehovah, Jehu yet tolerated the worship of the golden calves at Dan and Bethel. For this the divine displeasure rested upon him, and his kingdom suffered disaster in war with the Syrians ([2 Kings 10:29-33](/2kgs#2Kgs.10.29)). He died after a reign of twenty-eight years (B.C. 884-856), and was buried in Samaria (10:34-36). \u201cHe was one of those decisive, terrible, and ambitious, yet prudent, calculating, and passionless men whom God from time to time raises up to change the fate of empires and execute his judgments on the earth.\u201d He was the first Jewish king who came in contact with the Assyrian power in the time of Shalmaneser II.",

            "dictText": "One of the \u201cgreater prophets\u201d of the Old Testament, son of Hilkiah (q.v.), a priest of Anathoth ([Jer. 1:1](/jer#Jer.1.1); [32:6](/jer#Jer.32.6)). He was called to the prophetical office when still young (1:6), in the thirteenth year of Josiah (B.C. 628). He left his native place, and went to reside in Jerusalem, where he greatly assisted Josiah in his work of reformation ([2 Kings 23:1-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.1)). The death of this pious king was bewailed by the prophet as a national calamity ([2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)).\n\n During the three years of the reign of Jehoahaz we find no reference to Jeremiah, but in the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the enmity of the people against him broke out in bitter persecution, and he was placed apparently under restraint ([Jer. 36:5](/jer#Jer.36.5)). In the fourth year of Jehoiakim he was commanded to write the predictions given to him, and to read them to the people on the fast-day. This was done by Baruch his servant in his stead, and produced much public excitement. The roll was read to the king. In his recklessness he seized the roll, and cut it to pieces, and cast it into the fire, and ordered both Baruch and Jeremiah to be apprehended. Jeremiah procured another roll, and wrote in it the words of the roll the king had destroyed, and \u201cmany like words\u201d besides ([Jer. 36:32](/jer#Jer.36.32)).\n\n He remained in Jerusalem, uttering from time to time his words of warning, but without effect. He was there when Nebuchadnezzar besieged the city ([Jer. 37:4](/jer#Jer.37.4), [5](/jer#Jer.37.5)), B.C. 589. The rumour of the approach of the Egyptians to aid the Jews in this crisis induced the Chaldeans to withdraw and return to their own land. This, however, was only for a time. The prophet, in answer to his prayer, received a message from God announcing that the Chaldeans would come again and take the city, and burn it with fire (37:7, 8). The princes, in their anger at such a message by Jeremiah, cast him into prison (37:15-38:13). He was still in confinement when the city was taken (B.C. 588). The Chaldeans released him, and showed him great kindness, allowing him to choose the place of his residence. He accordingly went to Mizpah with Gedaliah, who had been made governor of Judea. Johanan succeeded Gedaliah, and refusing to listen to Jeremiah\u2019s counsels, went down into Egypt, taking Jeremiah and Baruch with him ([Jer. 43:6](/jer#Jer.43.6)). There probably the prophet spent the remainder of his life, in vain seeking still to turn the people to the Lord, from whom they had so long revolted (44). He lived till the reign of Evil-Merodach, son of Nebuchadnezzar, and must have been about ninety years of age at his death. We have no authentic record of his death. He may have died at Tahpanhes, or, according to a tradition, may have gone to Babylon with the army of Nebuchadnezzar; but of this there is nothing certain.",

Influenced by the words of the prophet Ahijah, he began to form conspiracies with the view of becoming king of the ten tribes; but these having been discovered, he fled to Egypt ([1 Kings 11:29-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.29)), where he remained for a length of time under the protection of Shishak I. On the death of Solomon, the ten tribes, having revolted, sent to invite him to become their king. The conduct of Rehoboam favoured the designs of Jeroboam, and he was accordingly proclaimed \u201cking of Israel\u201d ([1 Kings 12](/1kgs#1Kgs.12): 1-20). He rebuilt and fortified Shechem as the capital of his kingdom. He at once adopted means to perpetuate the division thus made between the two parts of the kingdom, and erected at Dan and Bethel, the two extremities of his kingdom, \u201cgolden calves,\u201d which he set up as symbols of Jehovah, enjoining the people not any more to go up to worship at Jerusalem, but to bring their offerings to the shrines he had erected. Thus he became distinguished as the man \u201cwho made Israel to sin.\u201d This policy was followed by all the succeeding kings of Israel.\n\n While he was engaged in offering incense at Bethel, a prophet from Judah appeared before him with a warning message from the Lord. Attempting to arrest the prophet for his bold words of defiance, his hand was \u201cdried up,\u201d and the altar before which he stood was rent asunder. At his urgent entreaty his \u201chand was restored him again\u201d ([1 Kings 13:1-6](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.1), [9](/1kgs#1Kgs.13.9); comp. [2 Kings 23:15](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.15)); but the miracle made no abiding impression on him. His reign was one of constant war with the house of Judah. He died soon after his son Abijah ([1 Kings 14:1-18](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.1)).",

He followed the example of the first Jeroboam in keeping up the worship of the golden calves ([2 Kings 14:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.24)). His reign was contemporary with those of Amaziah ([2 Kings 14:23](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.23)) and Uzziah (15:1), kings of Judah. He was victorious over the Syrians (13:4; 14:26, 27), and extended Israel to its former limits, from \u201cthe entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain\u201d (14:25; [Amos 6:14](/amos#Amos.6.14)). His reign of forty-one years was the most prosperous that Israel had ever known as yet. With all this outward prosperity, however, iniquity widely prevailed in the land ([Amos 2:6-8](/amos#Amos.2.6); [4:1](/amos#Amos.4.1); [6:6](/amos#Amos.6.6); [Hos. 4:12-14](/hos#Hos.4.12)). The prophets Hosea (1:1), Joel (3:16; [Amos 1:1](/amos#Amos.1.1), [2](/amos#Amos.1.2)), Amos (1:1), and Jonah ([2 Kings 14:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.25)) lived during his reign. He died, and was buried with his ancestors (14:29). He was succeeded by his son Zachariah (q.v.).\n\n His name occurs in Scripture only in [2 Kings 13:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.13.13); [14:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.16), [23](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.23), [27](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.27), [28](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.28), [29](/2kgs#2Kgs.14.29); [15:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.1), [8](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.8); [1 Chr. 5:17](/1chr#1Chr.5.17); [Hos. 1:1](/hos#Hos.1.1); [Amos 1:1](/amos#Amos.1.1); [7:9](/amos#Amos.7.9), [10](/amos#Amos.7.10), [11](/amos#Amos.7.11).

To distinguish him from others so called, he is spoken of as \u201cJesus of Nazareth\u201d ([John 18:7](/john#John.18.7)), and \u201cJesus the son of Joseph\u201d ([John 6:42](/john#John.6.42)).\n\n This is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua, which was originally Hoshea ([Num. 13:8](/num#Num.13.8), [16](/num#Num.13.16)), but changed by Moses into Jehoshua ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16); [1 Chr. 7:27](/1chr#1Chr.7.27)), or Joshua. After the Exile it assumed the form Jeshua, whence the Greek form Jesus. It was given to our Lord to denote the object of his mission, to save ([Matt. 1:21](/matt#Matt.1.21)).\n\n The life of Jesus on earth may be divided into two great periods, (1) that of his private life, till he was about thirty years of age; and (2) that of his public life, which lasted about three years.\n\n In the \u201cfulness of time\u201d he was born at Bethlehem, in the reign of the emperor Augustus, of Mary, who was betrothed to Joseph, a carpenter ([Matt. 1:1](/matt#Matt.1.1); [Luke 3:23](/luke#Luke.3.23); comp. [John 7:42](/john#John.7.42)). His birth was announced to the shepherds ([Luke 2:8-20](/luke#Luke.2.8)). Wise men from the east came to Bethlehem to see him who was born \u201cKing of the Jews,\u201d bringing gifts with them ([Matt. 2:1-12](/matt#Matt.2.1)). Herod\u2019s cruel jealousy led to Joseph\u2019s flight into Egypt with Mary and the infant Jesus, where they tarried till the death of this king ([Matt. 2:13-23](/matt#Matt.2.13)), when they returned and settled in Nazareth, in Lower Galilee (2:23; comp. [Luke 4:16](/luke#Luke.4.16); [John 1:46](/john#John.1.46), etc.). At the age of twelve years he went up to Jerusalem to the Passover with his parents. There, in the temple, \u201cin the midst of the doctors,\u201d all that heard him were \u201castonished at his understanding and answers\u201d ([Luke 2:41](/luke#Luke.2.41), etc.).\n\n Eighteen years pass, of which we have no record beyond this, that he returned to Nazareth and \u201cincreased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man\u201d ([Luke 2:52](/luke#Luke.2.52)).\n\n He entered on his public ministry when he was about thirty years of age. It is generally reckoned to have extended to about three years. \u201cEach of these years had peculiar features of its own.",

This was the \u201cfirst time that a king of Israel had allied himself by marriage with a heathen princess; and the alliance was in this case of a peculiarly disastrous kind. Jezebel has stamped her name on history as the representative of all that is designing, crafty, malicious, revengeful, and cruel. She is the first great instigator of persecution against the saints of God. Guided by no principle, restrained by no fear of either God or man, passionate in her attachment to her heathen worship, she spared no pains to maintain idolatry around her in all its splendour. Four hundred and fifty prophets ministered under her care to Baal, besides four hundred prophets of the groves [R.V., \u2019prophets of the Asherah\u2019], which ate at her table ([1 Kings 18:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.18.19)). The idolatry, too, was of the most debased and sensual kind.\u201d Her conduct was in many respects very disastrous to the kingdom both of Israel and Judah (21:1-29). At length she came to an untimely end. As Jehu rode into the gates of Jezreel, she looked out at the window of the palace, and said, \u201cHad Zimri peace, who slew his master?\u201d He looked up and called to her chamberlains, who instantly threw her from the window, so that she was dashed in pieces on the street, and his horses trod her under their feet. She was immediately consumed by the dogs of the street ([2 Kings 9:7-37](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.7)), according to the word of Elijah the Tishbite ([1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)).\n\n Her name afterwards came to be used as the synonym for a wicked woman ([Rev. 2](/rev#Rev.2): 20).\n\n It may be noted that she is said to have been the grand-aunt of Dido, the founder of Carthage.",

His father\u2019s name is nowhere mentioned, although his sepulchre at Bethlehem is mentioned ([2 Sam. 2:32](/2sam#2Sam.2.32)). His two brothers were Abishai and Asahel, the swift of foot, who was killed by Abner ([2 Sam. 2:13-32](/2sam#2Sam.2.13)), whom Joab afterwards treacherously murdered (3:22-27). He afterwards led the assault at the storming of the fortress on Mount Zion, and for this service was raised to the rank of \u201cprince of the king\u2019s army\u201d ([2 Sam. 5:6-10](/2sam#2Sam.5.6); [1 Chr. 27:34](/1chr#1Chr.27.34)). His chief military achievements were, (1) against the allied forces of Syria and Ammon; (2) against Edom ([1 Kings 11:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.15), [16](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.16)); and (3) against the Ammonites ([2 Sam. 10:7-19](/2sam#2Sam.10.7); [11:1](/2sam#2Sam.11.1), [11](/2sam#2Sam.11.11)). His character is deeply stained by the part he willingly took in the murder of Uriah (11:14-25). He acted apparently from a sense of duty in putting Absalom to death (18:1-14). David was unmindful of the many services Joab had rendered to him, and afterwards gave the command of the army to Amasa, Joab\u2019s cousin ([2 Sam. 20:1-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.1); [19:13](/2sam#2Sam.19.13)). When David was dying Joab espoused the cause of Adonijah in preference to that of Solomon. He was afterwards slain by Benaiah, by the command of Solomon, in accordance with his father\u2019s injunction ([2 Sam. 3:29](/2sam#2Sam.3.29); [20:5-13](/2sam#2Sam.20.5)), at the altar to which he had fled for refuge. Thus this hoary conspirator died without one to lift up a voice in his favour. He was buried in his own property in the \u201cwilderness,\u201d probably in the north-east of Jerusalem ([1 Kings 2:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.5), [28](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.28)-34). Benaiah succeeded him as commander-in-chief of the army.",

He was one, probably the younger, of the sons of Zebedee ([Matt. 4:21](/matt#Matt.4.21)) and Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); comp. [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40)), and was born at Bethsaida. His father was apparently a man of some wealth (comp. [Mark 1:20](/mark#Mark.1.20); [Luke 5:3](/luke#Luke.5.3); [John 19:27](/john#John.19.27)). He was doubtless trained in all that constituted the ordinary education of Jewish youth. When he grew up he followed the occupation of a fisherman on the Lake of Galilee. When John the Baptist began his ministry in the wilderness of Judea, John, with many others, gathered round him, and was deeply influenced by his teaching. There he heard the announcement, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God,\u201d and forthwith, on the invitation of Jesus, became a disciple and ranked among his followers ([John 1:36](/john#John.1.36), [37](/john#John.1.37)) for a time. He and his brother then returned to their former avocation, for how long is uncertain. Jesus again called them ([Matt. 4](/matt#Matt.4): 21; [Luke 5:1-11](/luke#Luke.5.1)), and now they left all and permanently attached themselves to the company of his disciples. He became one of the innermost circle ([Mark 5:37](/mark#Mark.5.37); [Matt. 17:1](/matt#Matt.17.1); [26:37](/matt#Matt.26.37); [Mark 13:3](/mark#Mark.13.3)). He was the disciple whom Jesus loved. In zeal and intensity of character he was a \u201cBoanerges\u201d ([Mark 3:17](/mark#Mark.3.17)). This spirit once and again broke out ([Matt. 20:20-24](/matt#Matt.20.20); [Mark 10:35-41](/mark#Mark.10.35); [Luke 9:49](/luke#Luke.9.49), [54](/luke#Luke.9.54)). At the betrayal he and Peter follow Christ afar off, while the others betake themselves to hasty flight ([John 18:15](/john#John.18.15)). At the trial he follows Christ into the council chamber, and thence to the praetorium (18:16, 19, 28) and to the place of crucifixion (19:26, 27). To him and Peter, Mary first conveys tidings of the resurrection (20:2), and they are the first to go and see what her strange words mean. After the resurrection he and Peter again return to the Sea of Galilee, where the Lord reveals himself to them (21:1, 7). We find Peter and John frequently after this together ([Acts 3:1](/acts#Acts.3.1); [4:13](/acts#Acts.4.13)). John remained apparently in Jerusalem as the leader of the church there ([Acts 15:6](/acts#Acts.15.6); [Gal. 2:9](/gal#Gal.2.9)). His subsequent history is unrecorded. He was not there, however, at the time of Paul\u2019s last visit ([Acts 21:15-40](/acts#Acts.21.15)). He appears to have retired to Ephesus, but at what time is unknown. The seven churches of Asia were the objects of his special care ([Rev. 1:11](/rev#Rev.1.11)). He suffered under persecution, and was banished to Patmos (1:9); whence he again returned to Ephesus, where he died, probably about A.D. 98, having outlived all or nearly all the friends and companions even of his maturer years. There are many interesting traditions regarding John during his residence at Ephesus, but these cannot claim the character of historical truth.",

            "dictText": "The \u201cforerunner of our Lord.\u201d We have but fragmentary and imperfect accounts of him in the Gospels. He was of priestly descent. His father, Zacharias, was a priest of the course of Abia ([1 Chr. 24:10](/1chr#1Chr.24.10)), and his mother, Elisabeth, was of the daughters of Aaron ([Luke 1:5](/luke#Luke.1.5)). The mission of John was the subject of prophecy ([Matt. 3:3](/matt#Matt.3.3); [Isa. 40:3](/isa#Isa.40.3); [Mal. 3:1](/mal#Mal.3.1)). His birth, which took place six months before that of Jesus, was foretold by an angel. Zacharias, deprived of the power of speech as a token of God\u2019s truth and a reproof of his own incredulity with reference to the birth of his son, had the power of speech restored to him on the occasion of his circumcision ([Luke 1:64](/luke#Luke.1.64)). After this no more is recorded of him for thirty years than what is mentioned in [Luke 1:80](/luke#Luke.1.80). John was a Nazarite from his birth ([Luke 1:15](/luke#Luke.1.15); [Num. 6:1-12](/num#Num.6.1)). He spent his early years in the mountainous tract of Judah lying between Jerusalem and the Dead Sea ([Matt. 3:1-12](/matt#Matt.3.1)).\n\n At length he came forth into public life, and great multitudes from \u201cevery quarter\u201d were attracted to him. The sum of his preaching was the necessity of repentance. He denounced the Sadducees and Pharisees as a \u201cgeneration of vipers,\u201d and warned them of the folly of trusting to external privileges ([Luke 3:8](/luke#Luke.3.8)). \u201cAs a preacher, John was eminently practical and discriminating. Self-love and covetousness were the prevalent sins of the people at large. On them, therefore, he enjoined charity and consideration for others. The publicans he cautioned against extortion, the soldiers against crime and plunder.\u201d His doctrine and manner of life roused the entire south of Palestine, and the people from all parts flocked to the place where he was, on the banks of the Jordan. There he baptized thousands unto repentance.\n\n The fame of John reached the ears of Jesus in Nazareth ([Matt. 3:5](/matt#Matt.3.5)), and he came from Galilee to Jordan to be baptized of John, on the special ground that it became him to \u201cfulfil all righteousness\u201d (3:15). John\u2019s special office ceased with the baptism of Jesus, who must now \u201cincrease\u201d as the King come to his kingdom. He continued, however, for a while to bear testimony to the Messiahship of Jesus. He pointed him out to his disciples, saying, \u201cBehold the Lamb of God.\u201d His public ministry was suddenly (after about six months probably) brought to a close by his being cast into prison by Herod, whom he had reproved for the sin of having taken to himself the wife of his brother Philip ([Luke 3:19](/luke#Luke.3.19)). He was shut up in the castle of Machaerus (q.v.), a fortress on the southern extremity of Peraea, 9 miles east of the Dead Sea, and here he was beheaded. His disciples, having consigned the headless body to the grave, went and told Jesus all that had occurred ([Matt. 14:3-12](/matt#Matt.14.3)). John\u2019s death occurred apparently just before the third Passover of our Lord\u2019s ministry. Our Lord himself testified regarding him that he was a \u201cburning and a shining light\u201d ([John 5:35](/john#John.5.35)).",

Like his father, he was a man of great strength and activity ([2 Sam. 1:23](/2sam#2Sam.1.23)), and excelled in archery and slinging ([1 Chr. 12:2](/1chr#1Chr.12.2);[2 Sam. 1:22](/2sam#2Sam.1.22)).

            "dictText": "The elder of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel ([Gen. 30:23](/gen#Gen.30.23), [24](/gen#Gen.30.24)), who, on the occasion of his birth, said, \u201cGod hath taken away [Heb. \u2018asaph] my reproach.\u201d \u201cThe Lord shall add [Heb. yoseph] to me another son\u201d ([Gen. 30:24](/gen#Gen.30.24)). He was a child of probably six years of age when his father returned from Haran to Canaan and took up his residence in the old patriarchal town of Hebron. \u201cNow Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age,\u201d and he \u201cmade him a long garment with sleeves\u201d ([Gen. 37:3](/gen#Gen.37.3), R.V. marg.), i.e., a garment long and full, such as was worn by the children of nobles. This seems to be the correct rendering of the words. The phrase, however, may also be rendered, \u201ca coat of many pieces\u201d, i.e., a patchwork of many small pieces of divers colours.\n\n When he was about seventeen years old Joseph incurred the jealous hatred of his brothers ([Gen. 37:4](/gen#Gen.37.4)). They \u201chated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.\u201d Their anger was increased when he told them his dreams (37:11).\n\n Jacob desiring to hear tidings of his sons, who had gone to Shechem with their flocks, some 60 miles from Hebron, sent Joseph as his messenger to make inquiry regarding them. Joseph found that they had left Shechem for Dothan, whither he followed them. As soon as they saw him coming they began to plot against him, and would have killed him had not Reuben interposed. They ultimately sold him to a company of Ishmaelite merchants for twenty pieces (shekels) of silver (about $2, 10s.), ten pieces less than the current value of a slave, for \u201cthey cared little what they had for him, if so be they were rid of him.\u201d These merchants were going down with a varied assortment of merchandise to the Egyptian market, and thither they conveyed him, and ultimately sold him as a slave to Potiphar, an \u201cofficer of Pharaoh\u2019s, and captain of the guard\u201d ([Gen. 37:36](/gen#Gen.37.36)). \u201cThe Lord blessed the Egyptian\u2019s house for Joseph\u2019s sake,\u201d and Potiphar made him overseer over his house. At length a false charge having been brought against him by Potiphar\u2019s wife, he was at once cast into the state prison (39; 40), where he remained for at least two years. After a while the \u201cchief of the cupbearers\u201d and the \u201cchief of the bakers\u201d of Pharaoh\u2019s household were cast into the same prison (40:2). Each of these new prisoners dreamed a dream in the same night, which Joseph interpreted, the event occurring as he had said.\n\n This led to Joseph\u2019s being remembered subsequently by the chief butler when Pharaoh also dreamed. At his suggestion Joseph was brought from prison to interpret the king\u2019s dreams. Pharaoh was well pleased with Joseph\u2019s wisdom in interpreting his dreams, and with his counsel with reference to the events then predicted; and he set him over all the land of Egypt ([Gen. 41:46](/gen#Gen.41.46)), and gave him the name of Zaphnath-paaneah. He was married to Asenath, the daughter of the priest of On, and thus became a member of the priestly class. Joseph was now about thirty years of age.\n\n As Joseph had interpreted, seven years of plenty came, during which he stored up great abundance of corn in granaries built for the purpose. These years were followed by seven years of famine \u201cover all the face of the earth,\u201d when \u201call countries came into Egypt to Joseph to buy corn\u201d ([Gen. 41:56](/gen#Gen.41.56), [57](/gen#Gen.41.57); 47:13, 14). Thus \u201cJoseph gathered up all the money that was in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought.\u201d Afterwards all the cattle and all the land, and at last the Egyptians themselves, became the property of Pharaoh.\n\n During this period of famine Joseph\u2019s brethren also came down to Egypt to buy corn. The history of his dealings with them, and of the manner in which he at length made himself known to them, is one of the most interesting narratives that can be read ([Gen. 42](/gen#Gen.42)-45). Joseph directed his brethren to return and bring Jacob and his family to the land of Egypt, saying, \u201cI will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. Regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land is yours.\u201d Accordingly Jacob and his family, to the number of threescore and ten souls, together with \u201call that they had,\u201d went down to Egypt. They were settled in the land of Goshen, where Joseph met his father, and \u201cfell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while\u201d ([Gen. 46:29](/gen#Gen.46.29)).\n\n The excavations of Dr. Naville have shown the land of Goshen to be the Wady Tumilat, between Ismailia and Zagazig. In Goshen (Egyptian Qosem) they had pasture for their flocks, were near the Asiatic frontier of Egypt, and were out of the way of the Egyptian people. An inscription speaks of it as a district given up to the wandering shepherds of Asia.\n\n Jacob at length died, and in fulfilment of a promise which he had exacted, Joseph went up to Canaan to bury his father in \u201cthe field of Ephron the Hittite\u201d ([Gen. 47:29-31](/gen#Gen.47.29); [50:1-14](/gen#Gen.50.1)). This was the last recorded act of Joseph, who again returned to Egypt.\n\n \u201cThe \u2018Story of the Two Brothers,\u2019 an Egyptian romance written for the son of the Pharaoh of the Oppression, contains an episode very similar to the Biblical account of Joseph\u2019s treatment by Potiphar\u2019s wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, \u2018the gift of the sun-god.\u2019 The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah, is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, \u2018nourisher of the living one,\u2019 i.e., of the Pharaoh. There are many instances in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian names, and rising to the highest offices of state.\u201d\n\n By his wife Asenath, Joseph had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim ([Gen. 41:50](/gen#Gen.41.50)). Joseph having obtained a promise from his brethren that when the time should come that God would \u201cbring them unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob,\u201d they would carry up his bones out of Egypt, at length died, at the age of one hundred and ten years; and \u201cthey embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin\u201d ([Gen. 50:26](/gen#Gen.50.26)). This promise was faithfully observed. Their descendants, long after, when the Exodus came, carried the body about with them during their forty years\u2019 wanderings, and at length buried it in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor ([Josh. 24:32](/josh#Josh.24.32); comp. [Gen. 33:19](/gen#Gen.33.19)). With the death of Joseph the patriarchal age of the history of Israel came to a close.\n\n The Pharaoh of Joseph\u2019s elevation was probably Apepi, or Apopis, the last of the Hyksos kings. Some, however, think that Joseph came to Egypt in the reign of Thothmes III. (see  PHARAOH), long after the expulsion of the Hyksos.\n\n The name Joseph denotes the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in [Deut. 33:13-17](/deut#Deut.33.13); the kingdom of Israel in [Ezek. 37:16](/ezek#Ezek.37.16), [19](/ezek#Ezek.37.19), [Amos 5:6](/amos#Amos.5.6); and the whole covenant people of Israel in [Ps. 81:4](/ps#Ps.81.4).",

            "dictText": "Jehovah is his help, or Jehovah the Saviour. The son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, the successor of Moses as the leader of Israel. He is called Jehoshua in [Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16) (A.V.), and Jesus in [Acts 7:45](/acts#Acts.7.45) and [Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8) (R.V., Joshua).\n\n He was born in Egypt, and was probably of the age of Caleb, with whom he is generally associated. He shared in all the events of the Exodus, and held the place of commander of the host of the Israelites at their great battle against the Amalekites in Rephidim ([Ex. 17:8-16](/exod#Exod.17.8)). He became Moses\u2019 minister or servant, and accompanied him part of the way when he ascended Mount Sinai to receive the two tables ([Ex. 32:17](/exod#Exod.32.17)). He was also one of the twelve who were sent on by Moses to explore the land of Canaan ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16), [17](/num#Num.13.17)), and only he and Caleb gave an encouraging report. Under the direction of God, Moses, before his death, invested Joshua in a public and solemn manner with authority over the people as his successor ([Deut. 31:23](/deut#Deut.31.23)). The people were encamped at Shittim when he assumed the command ([Josh. 1:1](/josh#Josh.1.1)); and crossing the Jordan, they encamped at Gilgal, where, having circumcised the people, he kept the Passover, and was visited by the Captain of the Lord\u2019s host, who spoke to him encouraging words (1:1-9).\n\n Now began the wars of conquest which Joshua carried on for many years, the record of which is in the book which bears his name. Six nations and thirty-one kings were conquered by him ([Josh. 11:18-23](/josh#Josh.11.18); [12:24](/josh#Josh.12.24)). Having thus subdued the Canaanites, Joshua divided the land among the tribes, Timnath-serah in Mount Ephraim being assigned to himself as his own inheritance. (See SHILOH; PRIEST.)\n\n His work being done, he died, at the age of one hundred and ten years, twenty-five years after having crossed the Jordan. He was buried in his own city of Timnath-serah ([Josh. 24](/josh#Josh.24)); and \u201cthe light of Israel for the time faded away.\u201d\n\n Joshua has been regarded as a type of Christ ([Heb. 4:8](/heb#Heb.4.8)) in the following particulars: (1) In the name common to both; (2) Joshua brings the people into the possession of the Promised Land, as Jesus brings his people to the heavenly Canaan; and (3) as Joshua succeeded Moses, so the Gospel succeeds the Law.\n\n The character of Joshua is thus well sketched by Edersheim:, \u201cBorn a slave in Egypt, he must have been about forty years old at the time of the Exodus. Attached to the person of Moses, he led Israel in the first decisive battle against Amalek ([Ex. 17:9](/exod#Exod.17.9), [13](/exod#Exod.17.13)), while Moses in the prayer of faith held up to heaven the God-given \u2018rod.\u2019 It was no doubt on that occasion that his name was changed from Oshea, \u2018help,\u2019 to Jehoshua, \u2018Jehovah is help\u2019 ([Num. 13:16](/num#Num.13.16)). And this name is the key to his life and work. Alike in bringing the people into Canaan, in his wars, and in the distribution of the land among the tribes, from the miraculous crossing of Jordan and taking of Jericho to his last address, he was the embodiment of his new name, \u2018Jehovah is help.\u2019 To this outward calling his character also corresponded. It is marked by singleness of purpose, directness, and decision...He sets an object before him, and unswervingly follows it\u201d (Bible Hist., iii. 103)",

His history is contained in [2 Kings 22](/2kgs#2Kgs.22), [23](/2kgs#2Kgs.23). He stands foremost among all the kings of the line of David for unswerving loyalty to Jehovah (23:25). He \u201cdid that which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way of David his father.\u201d He ascended the throne at the early age of eight years, and it appears that not till eight years afterwards did he begin \u201cto seek after the God of David his father.\u201d At that age he devoted himself to God. He distinguished himself by beginning a war of extermination against the prevailing idolatry, which had practically been the state religion for some seventy years ([2 Chr. 34:3](/2chr#2Chr.34.3); comp. [Jer. 25:3](/jer#Jer.25.3), [11](/jer#Jer.25.11), [29](/jer#Jer.25.29)).\n\n In the eighteenth year of his reign he proceeded to repair and beautify the temple, which by time and violence had become sorely dilapidated ([2 Kings 22:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3), [5](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.5), [6](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.6); 23:23; [2 Chr. 34:11](/2chr#2Chr.34.11)). While this work was being carried on, Hilkiah, the high priest, discovered a roll, which was probably the original copy of the law, the entire Pentateuch, written by Moses.\n\n When this book was read to him, the king was alarmed by the things it contained, and sent for Huldah, the \u201cprophetess,\u201d for her counsel. She spoke to him words of encouragement, telling him that he would be gathered to his fathers in peace before the threatened days of judgment came. Josiah immediately gathered the people together, and engaged them in a renewal of their ancient national covenant with God. The Passover was then celebrated, as in the days of his great predecessor, Hezekiah, with unusual magnificence. Nevertheless, \u201cthe Lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah\u201d ([2 Kings 22:3-20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.3); [23:21-27](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.21); [2 Chr. 35:1-19](/2chr#2Chr.35.1)). During the progress of this great religious revolution Jeremiah helped it on by his earnest exhortations.\n\n Soon after this, Pharaoh-Necho II. (q.v.), king of Egypt, in an expedition against the king of Assyria, with the view of gaining possession of Carchemish, sought a passage through the territory of Judah for his army. This Josiah refused to permit. He had probably entered into some new alliance with the king of Assyria, and faithful to his word he sought to oppose the progress of Necho.\n\n The army of Judah went out and encountered that of Egypt at Megiddo, on the verge of the plain of Esdraelon. Josiah went into the field in disguise, and was fatally wounded by a random arrow. His attendants conveyed him toward Jerusalem, but had only reached Hadadrimmon, a few miles south of Megiddo, when he died ([2 Kings 23:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.28), [30](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.30); comp. [2 Chr. 35:20-27](/2chr#2Chr.35.20)), after a reign of thirty-one years. He was buried with the greatest honours in fulfilment of Huldah\u2019s prophecy ([2 Kings 22:20](/2kgs#2Kgs.22.20); comp. [Jer. 34:5](/jer#Jer.34.5)). Jeremiah composed a funeral elegy on this the best of the kings of Israel ([Lam. 4:20](/lam#Lam.4.20); [2 Chr. 35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)). The outburst of national grief on account of his death became proverbial ([Zech. 12:11](/zech#Zech.12.11); comp. [Rev. 16:16](/rev#Rev.16.16)).",

His name is uniformly the last in the list of the apostles, as given in the synoptic (i.e., the first three) Gospels. The evil of his nature probably gradually unfolded itself till \u201cSatan entered into him\u201d ([John 13:27](/john#John.13.27)), and he betrayed our Lord (18:3). Afterwards he owned his sin with \u201can exceeding bitter cry,\u201d and cast the money he had received as the wages of his iniquity down on the floor of the sanctuary, and \u201cdeparted and went and hanged himself\u201d ([Matt. 27:5](/matt#Matt.27.5)). He perished in his guilt, and \u201cwent unto his own place\u201d ([Acts 1:25](/acts#Acts.1.25)). The statement in [Acts 1:18](/acts#Acts.1.18) that he \u201cfell headlong and burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out,\u201d is in no way contrary to that in [Matt. 27:5](/matt#Matt.27.5). The sucide first hanged himself, perhaps over the valley of Hinnom, \u201cand the rope giving way, or the branch to which he hung breaking, he fell down headlong on his face, and was crushed and mangled on the rocky pavement below.\u201d\n\n Why such a man was chosen to be an apostle we know not, but it is written that \u201cJesus knew from the beginning who should betray him\u201d ([John 6:64](/john#John.6.64)). Nor can any answer be satisfactorily given to the question as to the motives that led Judas to betray his Master. \u201cOf the motives that have been assigned we need not care to fix on any one as that which simply led him on. Crime is, for the most part, the result of a hundred motives rushing with bewildering fury through the mind of the criminal.\u201d",

This gave rise to murmurings and discontent, while the Israelites were encamped at Kadesh for the first time, which came to a head in a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, headed by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Two hundred and fifty princes, \u201cmen of renown\u201d i.e., well-known men from among the other tribes, joined this conspiracy. The whole company demanded of Moses and Aaron that the old state of things should be restored, alleging that \u201cthey took too much upon them\u201d ([Num. 16:1-3](/num#Num.16.1)). On the morning after the outbreak, Korah and his associates presented themselves at the door of the tabernacle, and \u201ctook every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon.\u201d But immediately \u201cfire from the Lord\u201d burst forth and destroyed them all ([Num. 16:35](/num#Num.16.35)).

After this he separated from him and settled in Sodom (13:5-13). There his righteous soul was \u201cvexed\u201d from day to day (2 Pet. 2:7), and he had great cause to regret this act. Not many years after the separation he was taken captive by Chedorlaomer, and was rescued by Abraham ([Gen. 14](/gen#Gen.14)). At length, when the judgment of God descended on the guilty cities of the plain ([Gen. 19:1-20](/gen#Gen.19.1)), Lot was miraculously delivered. When fleeing from the doomed city his wife \u201clooked back from behind him, and became a pillar of salt.\u201d There is to this day a peculiar crag at the south end of the Dead Sea, near Kumran, which the Arabs call Bint Sheik Lot, i.e., Lot\u2019s wife. It is \u201ca tall, isolated needle of rock, which really does bear a curious resemblance to an Arab woman with a child upon her shoulder.\u201d From the words of warning in [Luke 17:32](/luke#Luke.17.32), \u201cRemember Lot\u2019s wife,\u201d it would seem as if she had gone back, or tarried so long behind in the desire to save some of her goods, that she became involved in the destruction which fell on the city, and became a stiffened corpse, fixed for a time in the saline incrustations. She became \u201ca pillar of salt\u201d, i.e., as some think, of asphalt. (See SALT.)\n\n Lot and his daughters sought refuge first in Zoar, and then, fearing to remain there longer, retired to a cave in the neighbouring mountains ([Gen. 19:30](/gen#Gen.19.30)). Lot has recently been connected with the people called on the Egyptian monuments Rotanu or Lotanu, who is supposed to have been the hero of the Edomite tribe Lotan.",

From this time Luke was Paul\u2019s constant companion during his journey to Jerusalem (20:6-21:18). He again disappears from view during Paul\u2019s imprisonment at Jerusalem and Caesarea, and only reappears when Paul sets out for Rome (27:1), whither he accompanies him (28:2, 12-16), and where he remains with him till the close of his first imprisonment ([Philemon 1](/phlm#Phlm.1.1):24; [Col. 4:14](/col#Col.4.14)).

Nothing is known of him beyond what is contained in his book of prophecies. Some have supposed that the name is simply a title descriptive of his character as a messenger of Jehovah, and not a proper name. There is reason, however, to conclude that Malachi was the ordinary name of the prophet.\n\n He was contemporary with Nehemiah (comp. [Mal. 2:8](/mal#Mal.2.8) with [Neh. 13:15](/neh#Neh.13.15); [Mal. 2:10-16](/mal#Mal.2.10) with [Neh. 13:23](/neh#Neh.13.23)). No allusion is made to him by Ezra, and he does not mention the restoration of the temple, and hence it is inferred that he prophesied after Haggai and Zechariah, and when the temple services were still in existence ([Mal. 1:10](/mal#Mal.1.10); [3:1](/mal#Mal.3.1), [10](/mal#Mal.3.10)). It is probable that he delivered his prophecies about B.C. 420, after the second return of Nehemiah from Persia ([Neh. 13:6](/neh#Neh.13.6)), or possibly before his return.",

There is an account of his marriage to a Syrian ([1 Chr. 7:14](/1chr#1Chr.7.14)); and the only thing afterwards recorded of him is, that his grandchildren were \u201cbrought up upon Joseph\u2019s knees\u201d ([Gen. 50:23](/gen#Gen.50.23); R.V., \u201cborn upon Joseph\u2019s knees\u201d) i.e., were from their birth adopted by Joseph as his own children.\n\n The tribe of Manasseh was associated with that of Ephraim and Benjamin during the wanderings in the wilderness. They encamped on the west side of the tabernacle. According to the census taken at Sinai, this tribe then numbered 32,200 ([Num. 1:10](/num#Num.1.10), [35](/num#Num.1.35); 2:20, 21). Forty years afterwards its numbers had increased to 52,700 (26:34, 37), and it was at this time the most distinguished of all the tribes.\n\n The half of this tribe, along with Reuben and Gad, had their territory assigned them by Moses on the east of the Jordan ([Josh. 13:7-14](/josh#Josh.13.7)); but it was left for Joshua to define the limits of each tribe. This territory on the east of Jordan was more valuable and of larger extent than all that was allotted to the nine and a half tribes in the land of Palestine. It is sometimes called \u201cthe land of Gilead,\u201d and is also spoken of as \u201con the other side of Jordan.\u201d The portion given to the half tribe of Manasseh was the largest on the east of Jordan. It embraced the whole of Bashan. It was bounded on the south by Mahanaim, and extended north to the foot of Lebanon. Argob, with its sixty cities, that \u201cocean of basaltic rocks and boulders tossed about in the wildest confusion,\u201d lay in the midst of this territory.\n\n The whole \u201cland of Gilead\u201d having been conquered, the two and a half tribes left their wives and families in the fortified cities there, and accompanied the other tribes across the Jordan, and took part with them in the wars of conquest. The allotment of the land having been completed, Joshua dismissed the two and a half tribes, commending them for their heroic service ([Josh. 22:1-34](/josh#Josh.22.1)). Thus dismissed, they returned over Jordan to their own inheritance. (See ED.)\n\n On the west of Jordan the other half of the tribe of Manasseh was associated with Ephraim, and they had their portion in the very centre of Palestine, an area of about 1,300 square miles, the most valuable part of the whole country, abounding in springs of water. Manasseh\u2019s portion was immediately to the north of that of Ephraim ([Josh. 16](/josh#Josh.16)). Thus the western Manasseh defended the passes of Esdraelon as the eastern kept the passes of the Hauran.",

He was twelve years old when he began to reign ([2 Kings 21:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.1)), and he reigned fifty-five years (B.C. 698-643). Though he reigned so long, yet comparatively little is known of this king. His reign was a continuation of that of Ahaz, both in religion and national polity. He early fell under the influence of the heathen court circle, and his reign was characterized by a sad relapse into idolatry with all its vices, showing that the reformation under his father had been to a large extent only superficial ([Isa. 7:10](/isa#Isa.7.10); [2 Kings 21:10-15](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.10)). A systematic and persistent attempt was made, and all too successfully, to banish the worship of Jehovah out of the land. Amid this wide-spread idolatry there were not wanting, however, faithful prophets (Isaiah, Micah) who lifted up their voice in reproof and in warning. But their fidelity only aroused bitter hatred, and a period of cruel persecution against all the friends of the old religion began. \u201cThe days of Alva in Holland, of Charles IX. in France, or of the Covenanters under Charles II. in Scotland, were anticipated in the Jewish capital. The streets were red with blood.\u201d There is an old Jewish tradition that Isaiah was put to death at this time ([2 Kings 21:16](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.16); [24:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.3), [4](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.4); [Jer. 2:30](/jer#Jer.2.30)), having been sawn asunder in the trunk of a tree. [Psalms 49, 73, 77, 140](/ps#Ps.49 Ps.73 Ps.77 Ps.140), and 141 seem to express the feelings of the pious amid the fiery trials of this great persecution. Manasseh has been called the \u201cNero of Palestine.\u201d\n\n Esarhaddon, Sennacherib\u2019s successor on the Assyrian throne, who had his residence in Babylon for thirteen years (the only Assyrian monarch who ever reigned in Babylon), took Manasseh prisoner (B.C. 681) to Babylon. Such captive kings were usually treated with great cruelty. They were brought before the conqueror with a hook or ring passed through their lips or their jaws, having a cord attached to it, by which they were led. This is referred to in [2 Chr. 33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11), where the Authorized Version reads that Esarhaddon \u201ctook Manasseh among the thorns;\u201d while the Revised Version renders the words, \u201ctook Manasseh in chains;\u201d or literally, as in the margin, \u201cwith hooks.\u201d (Comp. [2 Kings 19:28](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.28).)\n\n The severity of Manasseh\u2019s imprisonment brought him to repentance. God heard his cry, and he was restored to his kingdom ([2 Chr. 33:11-13](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)). He abandoned his idolatrous ways, and enjoined the people to worship Jehovah; but there was no thorough reformation. After a lengthened reign extending through fifty-five years, the longest in the history of Judah, he died, and was buried in the garden of Uzza, the \u201cgarden of his own house\u201d ([2 Kings 21:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.17), [18](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.18); [2 Chr. 33:20](/2chr#2Chr.33.20)), and not in the city of David, among his ancestors. He was succeeded by his son Amon.\n\n In [Judg. 18:30](/judg#Judg.18.30) the correct reading is \u201cMoses,\u201d and not \u201cManasseh.\u201d The name \u201cManasseh\u201d is supposed to have been introduced by some transcriber to avoid the scandal of naming the grandson of Moses the great lawgiver as the founder of an idolatrous religion.",

He is called John in [Acts 13:5](/acts#Acts.13.5), [13](/acts#Acts.13.13), and Mark in 15:39, [2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11), etc.\n\n He was the son of Mary, a woman apparently of some means and influence, and was probably born in Jerusalem, where his mother resided ([Acts 12:12](/acts#Acts.12.12)). Of his father we know nothing. He was cousin of Barnabas ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10)). It was in his mother\u2019s house that Peter found \u201cmany gathered together praying\u201d when he was released from prison; and it is probable that it was here that he was converted by Peter, who calls him his \u201cson\u201d ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). It is probable that the \u201cyoung man\u201d spoken of in [Mark 14:51](/mark#Mark.14.51), [52](/mark#Mark.14.52) was Mark himself. He is first mentioned in [Acts 12:25](/acts#Acts.12.25).

Three years afterwards a \u201csharp contention\u201d arose between Paul and Barnabas (15:36-40), because Paul would not take Mark with him.

At a later period he was with Peter in Babylon ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)), then, and for some centuries afterwards, one of the chief seats of Jewish learning; and he was with Timothy in Ephesus when Paul wrote him during his second imprisonment ([2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)).

Little is known of her personal history. Her genealogy is given in [Luke 3](/luke#Luke.3). She was of the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David ([Ps. 132:11](/ps#Ps.132.11); [Luke 1:32](/luke#Luke.1.32)). She was connected by marriage with Elisabeth, who was of the lineage of Aaron ([Luke 1:36](/luke#Luke.1.36)).\n\n While she resided at Nazareth with her parents, before she became the wife of Joseph, the angel Gabriel announced to her that she was to be the mother of the promised Messiah ([Luke 1:35](/luke#Luke.1.35)). After this she went to visit her cousin Elisabeth, who was living with her husband Zacharias (probably at Juttah, [Josh. 15:55](/josh#Josh.15.55); [21:16](/josh#Josh.21.16), in the neighbourhood of Maon), at a considerable distance, about 100 miles, from Nazareth. Immediately on entering the house she was saluted by Elisabeth as the mother of her Lord, and then forthwith gave utterance to her hymn of thanksgiving ([Luke 1:46-56](/luke#Luke.1.46); comp. [1 Sam. 2:1-10](/1sam#1Sam.2.1)). After three months Mary returned to Nazareth to her own home. Joseph was supernaturally made aware ([Matt. 1:18-25](/matt#Matt.1.18)) of her condition, and took her to his own home. Soon after this the decree of Augustus ([Luke 2:1](/luke#Luke.2.1)) required that they should proceed to Bethlehem ([Micah 5:2](/mic#Mic.5.2)), some 80 or 90 miles from Nazareth; and while they were there they found shelter in the inn or khan provided for strangers ([Luke 2:6](/luke#Luke.2.6), [7](/luke#Luke.2.7)). But as the inn was crowded, Mary had to retire to a place among the cattle, and there she brought forth her son, who was called Jesus ([Matt. 1:21](/matt#Matt.1.21)), because he was to save his people from their sins. This was followed by the presentation in the temple, the flight into Egypt, and their return in the following year and residence at Nazareth ([Matt. 2](/matt#Matt.2)). There for thirty years Mary, the wife of Joseph the carpenter, resides, filling her own humble sphere, and pondering over the strange things that had happened to her. During these years only one event in the history of Jesus is recorded, viz., his going up to Jerusalem when twelve years of age, and his being found among the doctors in the temple ([Luke 2:41-52](/luke#Luke.2.41)). Probably also during this period Joseph died, for he is not again mentioned.\n\n After the commencement of our Lord\u2019s public ministry little notice is taken of Mary. She was present at the marriage in Cana. A year and a half after this we find her at Capernaum ([Matt. 12:46](/matt#Matt.12.46), [48](/matt#Matt.12.48), [49](/matt#Matt.12.49)), where Christ uttered the memorable words, \u201cWho is my mother? and who are my brethren? And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!\u201d The next time we find her is at the cross along with her sister Mary, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other women ([John 19:26](/john#John.19.26)). From that hour John took her to his own abode. She was with the little company in the upper room after the Ascension ([Acts 1:14](/acts#Acts.1.14)).

On the occasion of our Lord\u2019s last visit to Bethany, Mary brought \u201ca pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus\u201d as he reclined at table in the house of one Simon, who had been a leper ([Matt. 26:6](/matt#Matt.26.6); [Mark 14:3](/mark#Mark.14.3); [John 12:2](/john#John.12.2), [3](/john#John.12.3)). This was an evidence of her overflowing love to the Lord. Nothing is known of her subsequent history. It would appear from this act of Mary\u2019s, and from the circumstance that they possessed a family vault (11:38), and that a large number of Jews from Jerusalem came to condole with them on the death of Lazarus (11:19), that this family at Bethany belonged to the wealthier class of the people.

He is subsequently mentioned only once in the Old Testament, in [Ps. 110:4](/ps#Ps.110.4). The typical significance of his history is set forth in detail in the Epistle to the Hebrews, ch. 7. The apostle there points out the superiority of his priesthood to that of Aaron in these several respects, (1) Even Abraham paid him tithes; (2) he blessed Abraham; (3) he is the type of a Priest who lives for ever; (4) Levi, yet unborn, paid him tithes in the person of Abraham; (5) the permanence of his priesthood in Christ implied the abrogation of the Levitical system; (6) he was made priest not without an oath; and (7) his priesthood can neither be transmitted nor interrupted by death: \u201cthis man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.\u201d\n\n The question as to who this mysterious personage was has given rise to a great deal of modern speculation. It is an old tradition among the Jews that he was Shem, the son of Noah, who may have survived to this time. Melchizedek was a Canaanitish prince, a worshipper of the true God, and in his peculiar history and character an instructive type of our Lord, the great High Priest ([Heb. 5:6](/heb#Heb.5.6), [7](/heb#Heb.5.7); 6:20). One of the Amarna tablets is from Ebed-Tob, king of Jerusalem, the successor of Melchizedek, in which he claims the very attributes and dignity given to Melchizedek in the Epistle to the Hebrews.",

The whole land was devastated by the conquering armies, and Mesha sought refuge in his last stronghold, Kir-harasheth (q.v.).

Jehoshaphat agreed, but suggested that inquiry should be first made \u201cat the word of Jehovah.\u201d Ahab\u2019s prophets approved of the expedition; but Jehoshaphat, still dissatisfied, asked if there was no other prophet besides the four hundred that had appeared, and was informed of this Micaiah. He was sent for from prison, where he had been confined, probably on account of some prediction disagreeable to Ahab; and he condemned the expedition, and prophesied that it would end, as it did, in disaster. We hear nothing further of this prophet. Some have supposed that he was the unnamed prophet referred to in [1 Kings 20:35-42](/1kgs#1Kgs.20.35).",

She showed her affection for him by promoting his escape to Naioth when Saul sought his life ([1 Sam. 19:12-17](/1sam#1Sam.19.12). Comp. [Ps. 59](/ps#Ps.59). See  TERAPHIM). After this she did not see David for many years. Meanwhile she was given in marriage to another man, Phalti or Phaltiel of Gallim ([1 Sam. 25:44](/1sam#1Sam.25.44)), but David afterwards formally reclaimed her as his lawful wife ([2 Sam. 3:13-16](/2sam#2Sam.3.13)). The relation between her and David soon after this was altered. They became alienated from each other. This happened on that memorable day when the ark was brought up in great triumph from its temporary resting-place to the Holy City. In David\u2019s conduct on that occasion she saw nothing but a needless humiliation of the royal dignity ([1 Chr. 15:29](/1chr#1Chr.15.29)). She remained childless, and thus the races of David and Saul were not mixed. In [2 Sam. 21:8](/2sam#2Sam.21.8) her name again occurs, but the name Merab should probably be here substituted for Michal (comp. [1 Sam. 18:19](/1sam#1Sam.18.19)).",

Solomon ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7)) erected a high place for this idol on the Mount of Olives, and from that time till the days of Josiah his worship continued ([2 Kings 23:10](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.10), [13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13)). In the days of Jehoahaz it was partially restored, but after the Captivity wholly disappeared. He is also called Molech ([Lev. 18:21](/lev#Lev.18.21); [20:2-5](/lev#Lev.20.2), etc.), Milcom ([1 Kings 11:5](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.5), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33), etc.), and Malcham ([Zeph. 1:5](/zeph#Zeph.1.5)). This god became Chemosh among the Moabites.",

It has been alleged that he was carried into captivity with Jeconiah, and hence that he must have been at least one hundred and twenty-nine years old in the twelfth year of Ahasuerus (Xerxes). But the words of Esther do not necessarily lead to this conclusion. It was probably Kish of whom it is said (ver. 6) that he \u201chad been carried away with the captivity.\u201d\n\n He resided at Susa, the metropolis of Persia. He adopted his cousin Hadassah (Esther), an orphan child, whom he tenderly brought up as his own daughter. When she was brought into the king\u2019s harem and made queen in the room of the deposed queen Vashti, he was promoted to some office in the court of Ahasuerus, and was one of those who \u201csat in the king\u2019s gate\u201d ([Esther 2:21](/esth#Esth.2.21)). While holding this office, he discovered a plot of the eunuchs to put the king to death, which, by his vigilance, was defeated. His services to the king in this matter were duly recorded in the royal chronicles.\n\n Haman (q.v.) the Agagite had been raised to the highest position at court. Mordecai refused to bow down before him; and Haman, being stung to the quick by the conduct of Mordecai, resolved to accomplish his death in a wholesale destruction of the Jewish exiles throughout the Persian empire ([Esther 3:8-15](/esth#Esth.3.8)). Tidings of this cruel scheme soon reached the ears of Mordecai, who communicated with Queen Esther regarding it, and by her wise and bold intervention the scheme was frustrated. The Jews were delivered from destruction, Mordecai was raised to a high rank, and Haman was executed on the gallows he had by anticipation erected for Mordecai (6:2-7:10). In memory of the signal deliverance thus wrought for them, the Jews to this day celebrate the feast (9:26-32) of Purim (q.v.).",

            "dictText": "Drawn (or Egypt. mesu, \u201cson;\u201d hence Rameses, royal son). On the invitation of Pharaoh ([Gen. 45:17-25](/gen#Gen.45.17)), Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt. This immigration took place probably about 350 years before the birth of Moses. Some centuries before Joseph, Egypt had been conquered by a pastoral Semitic race from Asia, the Hyksos, who brought into cruel subjection the native Egyptians, who were an African race. Jacob and his retinue were accustomed to a shepherd\u2019s life, and on their arrival in Egypt were received with favour by the king, who assigned them the \u201cbest of the land\u201d, the land of Goshen, to dwell in. The Hyksos or \u201cshepherd\u201d king who thus showed favour to Joseph and his family was in all probability the Pharaoh Apopi (or Apopis).\n\n Thus favoured, the Israelites began to \u201cmultiply exceedingly\u201d ([Gen. 47:27](/gen#Gen.47.27)), and extended to the west and south. At length the supremacy of the Hyksos came to an end. The descendants of Jacob were allowed to retain their possession of Goshen undisturbed, but after the death of Joseph their position was not so favourable. The Egyptians began to despise them, and the period of their \u201caffliction\u201d ([Gen. 15:13](/gen#Gen.15.13)) commenced. They were sorely oppressed. They continued, however, to increase in numbers, and \u201cthe land was filled with them\u201d ([Ex. 1:7](/exod#Exod.1.7)). The native Egyptians regarded them with suspicion, so that they felt all the hardship of a struggle for existence.\n\n In process of time \u201ca king [probably Seti I.] arose who knew not Joseph\u201d ([Ex. 1:8](/exod#Exod.1.8)). (See PHARAOH.) The circumstances of the country were such that this king thought it necessary to weaken his Israelite subjects by oppressing them, and by degrees reducing their number. They were accordingly made public slaves, and were employed in connection with his numerous buildings, especially in the erection of store-cities, temples, and palaces. The children of Israel were made to serve with rigour. Their lives were made bitter with hard bondage, and \u201call their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour\u201d ([Ex. 1:13](/exod#Exod.1.13), [14](/exod#Exod.1.14)). But this cruel oppression had not the result expected of reducing their number. On the contrary, \u201cthe more the Egyptians afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew\u201d ([Ex. 1:12](/exod#Exod.1.12)).\n\n The king next tried, through a compact secretly made with the guild of midwives, to bring about the destruction of all the Hebrew male children that might be born. But the king\u2019s wish was not rigorously enforced; the male children were spared by the midwives, so that \u201cthe people multiplied\u201d more than ever. Thus baffled, the king issued a public proclamation calling on the people to put to death all the Hebrew male children by casting them into the river ([Ex. 1:22](/exod#Exod.1.22)). But neither by this edict was the king\u2019s purpose effected.\n\n One of the Hebrew households into which this cruel edict of the king brought great alarm was that of Amram, of the family of the Kohathites ([Ex. 6:16-20](/exod#Exod.6.16)), who with his wife Jochebed and two children, Miriam, a girl of perhaps fifteen years of age, and Aaron, a boy of three years, resided in or near Memphis, the capital city of that time. In this quiet home a male child was born (B.C. 1571). His mother concealed him in the house for three months from the knowledge of the civic authorities. But when the task of concealment became difficult, Jochebed contrived to bring her child under the notice of the daughter of the king by constructing for him an ark of bulrushes, which she laid among the flags which grew on the edge of the river at the spot where the princess was wont to come down and bathe. Her plan was successful. The king\u2019s daughter \u201csaw the child; and behold the child wept.\u201d The princess (see  PHARAOH\u2019S DAUGHTER [1]) sent Miriam, who was standing by, to fetch a nurse. She went and brought the mother of the child, to whom the princess said, \u201cTake this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages.\u201d Thus Jochebed\u2019s child, whom the princess called \u201cMoses\u201d, i.e., \u201cSaved from the water\u201d ([Ex. 2:10](/exod#Exod.2.10)), was ultimately restored to her.\n\n As soon as the natural time for weaning the child had come, he was transferred from the humble abode of his father to the royal palace, where he was brought up as the adopted son of the princess, his mother probably accompanying him and caring still for him. He grew up amid all the grandeur and excitement of the Egyptian court, maintaining, however, probably a constant fellowship with his mother, which was of the highest importance as to his religious belief and his interest in his \u201cbrethren.\u201d His education would doubtless be carefully attended to, and he would enjoy all the advantages of training both as to his body and his mind. He at length became \u201clearned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\u201d ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)). Egypt had then two chief seats of learning, or universities, at one of which, probably that of Heliopolis, his education was completed. Moses, being now about twenty years of age, spent over twenty more before he came into prominence in Bible history. These twenty years were probably spent in military service. There is a tradition recorded by Josephus that he took a lead in the war which was then waged between Egypt and Ethiopia, in which he gained renown as a skilful general, and became \u201cmighty in deeds\u201d ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)).\n\n After the termination of the war in Ethiopia, Moses returned to the Egyptian court, where he might reasonably have expected to be loaded with honours and enriched with wealth. But \u201cbeneath the smooth current of his life hitherto, a life of alternate luxury at the court and comparative hardness in the camp and in the discharge of his military duties, there had lurked from childhood to youth, and from youth to manhood, a secret discontent, perhaps a secret ambition. Moses, amid all his Egyptian surroundings, had never forgotten, had never wished to forget, that he was a Hebrew.\u201d He now resolved to make himself acquainted with the condition of his countrymen, and \u201cwent out unto his brethren, and looked upon their burdens\u201d ([Ex. 2:11](/exod#Exod.2.11)). This tour of inspection revealed to him the cruel oppression and bondage under which they everywhere groaned, and could not fail to press on him the serious consideration of his duty regarding them. The time had arrived for his making common cause with them, that he might thereby help to break their yoke of bondage. He made his choice accordingly ([Heb. 11:25-27](/heb#Heb.11.25)), assured that God would bless his resolution for the welfare of his people. He now left the palace of the king and took up his abode, probably in his father\u2019s house, as one of the Hebrew people who had for forty years been suffering cruel wrong at the hands of the Egyptians.\n\n He could not remain indifferent to the state of things around him, and going out one day among the people, his indignation was roused against an Egyptian who was maltreating a Hebrew. He rashly lifted up his hand and slew the Egyptian, and hid his body in the sand. Next day he went out again and found two Hebrews striving together. He speedily found that the deed of the previous day was known. It reached the ears of Pharaoh (the \u201cgreat Rameses,\u201d Rameses II.), who \u201csought to slay Moses\u201d ([Ex. 2:15](/exod#Exod.2.15)). Moved by fear, Moses fled from Egypt, and betook himself to the land of Midian, the southern part of the peninsula of Sinai, probably by much the same route as that by which, forty years afterwards, he led the Israelites to Sinai. He was providentially led to find a new home with the family of Reuel, where he remained for forty years ([Acts 7:30](/acts#Acts.7.30)), under training unconsciously for his great life\u2019s work.\n\n Suddenly the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the burning bush ([Ex. 3](/exod#Exod.3)), and commissioned him to go down to Egypt and \u201cbring forth the children of Israel\u201d out of bondage. He was at first unwilling to go, but at length he was obedient to the heavenly vision, and left the land of Midian (4:18-26). On the way he was met by Aaron (q.v.) and the elders of Israel (27-31). He and Aaron had a hard task before them; but the Lord was with them (ch. 7-12), and the ransomed host went forth in triumph. (See EXODUS.) After an eventful journey to and fro in the wilderness, we see them at length encamped in the plains of Moab, ready to cross over the Jordan into the Promised Land. There Moses addressed the assembled elders ([Deut. 1:1-4](/deut#Deut.1.1); [5:1-26:19](/deut#Deut.5.1); [27:11-30:20](/deut#Deut.27.11)), and gives the people his last counsels, and then rehearses the great song ([Deut. 32](/deut#Deut.32)), clothing in fitting words the deep emotions of his heart at such a time, and in review of such a marvellous history as that in which he had acted so conspicious a part. Then, after blessing the tribes (33), he ascends to \u201cthe mountain of Nebo (q.v.), to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho\u201d (34:1), and from thence he surveys the land. \u201cJehovah shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar\u201d ([Deut. 34:2-3](/deut#Deut.34.2)), the magnificient inheritance of the tribes of whom he had been so long the leader; and there he died, being one hundred and twenty years old, according to the word of the Lord, and was buried by the Lord \u201cin a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor\u201d (34:6). The people mourned for him during thirty days.\n\n Thus died \u201cMoses the man of God\u201d ([Deut. 33:1](/deut#Deut.33.1); [Josh. 14:6](/josh#Josh.14.6)). He was distinguished for his meekness and patience and firmness, and \u201che endured as seeing him who is invisible.\u201d \u201cThere arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel\u201d ([Deut. 34:10-12](/deut#Deut.34.10)).\n\n The name of Moses occurs frequently in the Psalms and Prophets as the chief of the prophets.\n\n In the New Testament he is referred to as the representative of the law and as a type of Christ ([John 1:17](/john#John.1.17); [2 Cor. 3:13-18](/2cor#2Cor.3.13); [Heb. 3:5](/heb#Heb.3.5), [6](/heb#Heb.3.6)). Moses is the only character in the Old Testament to whom Christ likens himself ([John 5:46](/john#John.5.46); comp. [Deut. 18:15](/deut#Deut.18.15), [18](/deut#Deut.18.18), [19](/deut#Deut.18.19); [Acts 7:37](/acts#Acts.7.37)). In [Heb. 3:1-19](/heb#Heb.3.1) this likeness to Moses is set forth in various particulars.\n\n In [Jude 1](/jude#Jude.1.1):9 mention is made of a contention between Michael and the devil about the body of Moses. This dispute is supposed to have had reference to the concealment of the body of Moses so as to prevent idolatry.",

The narrative contains all that is known of the Syrian commander. He was cured of his leprosy by dipping himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of Elisha. His cure is alluded to by our Lord ([Luke 4:27](/luke#Luke.4.27)).",

He was \u201cvery great, and he had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats...but the man was churlish and evil in his doings.\u201d During his wanderings David came into that district, and hearing that Nabal was about to shear his sheep, he sent ten of his young men to ask \u201cwhatsoever cometh unto thy hand for thy servants.\u201d Nabal insultingly resented the demand, saying, \u201cWho is David, and who is the son of Jesse?\u201d ([1 Sam. 25:10](/1sam#1Sam.25.10), [11](/1sam#1Sam.25.11)). One of the shepherds that stood by and saw the reception David\u2019s messengers had met with, informed Abigail, Nabal\u2019s wife, who at once realized the danger that threatened her household. She forthwith proceeded to the camp of David, bringing with her ample stores of provisions (25:18). She so courteously and persuasively pled her cause that David\u2019s anger was appeased, and he said to her, \u201cBlessed be the Lord God of Israel which sent thee this day to meet me.\u201d\n\n On her return she found her husband incapable from drunkenness of understanding the state of matters, and not till the following day did she explain to him what had happened. He was stunned by a sense of the danger to which his conduct had exposed him. \u201cHis heart died within him, and he became as a stone.\u201d and about ten days after \u201cthe Lord smote Nabal that he died\u201d ([1 Sam. 25:37](/1sam#1Sam.25.37), [38](/1sam#1Sam.25.38)).

This small \u201cplat of ground\u201d seems to have been all he possessed. It was a vineyard, and lay \u201chard by the palace of Ahab\u201d ([1 Kings 21:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.1), [2](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.2)), who greatly coveted it. Naboth, however, refused on any terms to part with it to the king. He had inherited it from his fathers, and no Israelite could lawfully sell his property ([Lev. 25:23](/lev#Lev.25.23)). Jezebel, Ahab\u2019s wife, was grievously offended at Naboth\u2019s refusal to part with his vineyard. By a crafty and cruel plot she compassed his death. His sons also shared his fate ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26); [1 Kings 21:19](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.19)). She then came to Ahab and said, \u201cArise, take possession of the vineyard; for Naboth is not alive, but dead.\u201d Ahab arose and went forth into the garden which had so treacherously and cruelly been acquired, seemingly enjoying his new possession, when, lo, Elijah suddenly appeared before him and pronounced against him a fearful doom ([1 Kings 21:17-24](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.17)). Jehu and Bidcar were with Ahab at this time, and so deeply were the words of Elijah imprinted on Jehu\u2019s memory that many years afterwards he refers to them ([2 Kings 9:26](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.26)), and he was the chief instrument in inflicting this sentence on Ahab and Jezebel and all their house (9:30-37). The house of Ahab was extinguished by him. Not one of all his great men and his kinsfolk and his priests did Jehu spare (10:11).\n\n Ahab humbled himself at Elijah\u2019s words ([1 Kings 21:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.28), [29](/1kgs#1Kgs.21.29)), and therefore the prophecy was fulfilled not in his fate but in that of his son Joram ([2 Kings 9:25](/2kgs#2Kgs.9.25)).\n\n The history of Naboth, compared with that of Ahab and Jezebel, furnishes a remarkable illustration of the law of a retributive providence, a law which runs through all history (comp. [Ps. 109:17](/ps#Ps.109.17), [18](/ps#Ps.109.18)).",

He was the greatest and most powerful of all the Babylonian kings. He married the daughter of Cyaxares, and thus the Median and Babylonian dynasties were united.\n\n Necho II., the king of Egypt, gained a victory over the Assyrians at Carchemish. (See JOSIAH; MEGIDDO.) This secured to Egypt the possession of the Syrian provinces of Assyria, including Palestine. The remaining provinces of the Assyrian empire were divided between Babylonia and Media. But Nabopolassar was ambitious of reconquering from Necho the western provinces of Syria, and for this purpose he sent his son with a powerful army westward ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1)). The Egyptians met him at Carchemish, where a furious battle was fought, resulting in the complete rout of the Egyptians, who were driven back ([Jer. 46:2-12](/jer#Jer.46.2)), and Syria and Phoenicia brought under the sway of Babylon (B.C. 606). From that time \u201cthe king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land\u201d ([2 Kings 24:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.7)). Nebuchadnezzar also subdued the whole of Palestine, and took Jerusalem, carrying away captive a great multitude of the Jews, among whom were Daniel and his companions ([Dan. 1:1](/dan#Dan.1.1), [2](/dan#Dan.1.2); [Jer. 27:19](/jer#Jer.27.19); [40:1](/jer#Jer.40.1)).\n\n Three years after this, Jehoiakim, who had reigned in Jerusalem as a Babylonian vassal, rebelled against the oppressor, trusting to help from Egypt ([2 Kings 24:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.1)). This led Nebuchadnezzar to march an army again to the conquest of Jerusalem, which at once yielded to him (B.C. 598). A third time he came against it, and deposed Jehoiachin, whom he carried into Babylon, with a large portion of the population of the city, and the sacred vessels of the temple, placing Zedekiah on the throne of Judah in his stead. He also, heedless of the warnings of the prophet, entered into an alliance with Egypt, and rebelled against Babylon. This brought about the final siege of the city, which was at length taken and utterly destroyed (B.C. 586). Zedekiah was taken captive, and had his eyes put out by order of the king of Babylon, who made him a prisoner for the remainder of his life.\n\n An onyx cameo, now in the museum of Florence, bears on it an arrow-headed inscription, which is certainly ancient and genuine. The helmeted profile is said (Schrader) to be genuine also, but it is more probable that it is the portrait of a usurper in the time of Darius (Hystaspes), called Nidinta-Bel, who took the name of \u201cNebuchadrezzar.\u201d The inscription has been thus translated:, \u201cIn honour of Merodach, his lord, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, in his lifetime had this made.\u201d\n\n A clay tablet, now in the British Museum, bears the following inscription, the only one as yet found which refers to his wars: \u201cIn the thirty-seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the country of Babylon, he went to Egypt [Misr] to make war. Amasis, king of Egypt, collected [his army], and marched and spread abroad.\u201d Thus were fulfilled the words of the prophet ([Jer. 46:13-26](/jer#Jer.46.13); [Ezek. 29:2-20](/ezek#Ezek.29.2)). Having completed the subjugation of Phoenicia, and inflicted chastisement on Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar now set himself to rebuild and adorn the city of Babylon ([Dan. 4:30](/dan#Dan.4.30)), and to add to the greatness and prosperity of his kingdom by constructing canals and aqueducts and reservoirs surpassing in grandeur and magnificence everything of the kind mentioned in history ([Dan. 2:37](/dan#Dan.2.37)). He is represented as a \u201cking of kings,\u201d ruling over a vast kingdom of many provinces, with a long list of officers and rulers under him, \u201cprinces, governors, captains,\u201d etc. (3:2, 3, 27). He may, indeed, be said to have created the mighty empire over which he ruled.\n\n \u201cModern research has shown that Nebuchadnezzar was the greatest monarch that Babylon, or perhaps the East generally, ever produced. He must have possessed an enormous command of human labour, nine-tenths of Babylon itself, and nineteen-twentieths of all the other ruins that in almost countless profusion cover the land, are composed of bricks stamped with his name. He appears to have built or restored almost every city and temple in the whole country. His inscriptions give an elaborate account of the immense works which he constructed in and about Babylon itself, abundantly illustrating the boast, \u2018Is not this great Babylon which I have build?\u2019\u201d Rawlinson, Hist. Illustrations.\n\n After the incident of the \u201cburning fiery furnace\u201d ([Dan. 3](/dan#Dan.3)) into which the three Hebrew confessors were cast, Nebuchadnezzar was afflicted with some peculiar mental aberration as a punishment for his pride and vanity, probably the form of madness known as lycanthropy (i.e, \u201cthe change of a man into a wolf\u201d). A remarkable confirmation of the Scripture narrative is afforded by the recent discovery of a bronze door-step, which bears an inscription to the effect that it was presented by Nebuchadnezzar to the great temple at Borsippa as a votive offering on account of his recovery from a terrible illness. (See DANIEL.)\n\n He survived his recovery for some years, and died B.C. 562, in the eighty-third or eighty-fourth year of his age, after a reign of forty-three years, and was succeeded by his son Evil-merodach, who, after a reign of two years, was succeeded by Neriglissar (559-555), who was succeeded by Nabonadius (555-538), at the close of whose reign (less than a quarter of a century after the death of Nebuchadnezzar) Babylon fell under Cyrus at the head of the combined armies of Media and Persia.\n\n \u201cI have examined,\u201d says Sir H. Rawlinson, \u201cthe bricks belonging perhaps to a hundred different towns and cities in the neighbourhood of Baghdad, and I never found any other legend than that of Nebuchadnezzar, son of Nabopolassar, king of Babylon.\u201d Nine-tenths of all the bricks amid the ruins of Babylon are stamped with his name.",

            "dictText": "The son of Hachaliah ([Neh. 1:1](/neh#Neh.1.1)), and probably of the tribe of Judah. His family must have belonged to Jerusalem ([Neh. 2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)). He was one of the \u201cJews of the dispersion,\u201d and in his youth was appointed to the important office of royal cup-bearer at the palace of Shushan. The king, Artaxerxes Longimanus, seems to have been on terms of friendly familiarity with his attendant. Through his brother Hanani, and perhaps from other sources ([Neh. 1:2](/neh#Neh.1.2); [2:3](/neh#Neh.2.3)), he heard of the mournful and desolate condition of the Holy City, and was filled with sadness of heart. For many days he fasted and mourned and prayed for the place of his fathers\u2019 sepulchres. At length the king observed his sadness of countenance and asked the reason of it. Nehemiah explained it all to the king, and obtained his permission to go up to Jerusalem and there to act as tirshatha, or governor of Judea. He went up in the spring of B.C. 446 (eleven years after Ezra), with a strong escort supplied by the king, and with letters to all the pashas of the provinces through which he had to pass, as also to Asaph, keeper of the royal forests, directing him to assist Nehemiah. On his arrival he set himself to survey the city, and to form a plan for its restoration; a plan which he carried out with great skill and energy, so that the whole was completed in about six months. He remained in Judea for thirteen years as governor, carrying out many reforms, notwithstanding much opposition that he encountered ([Neh. 13:11](/neh#Neh.13.11)). He built up the state on the old lines, \u201csupplementing and completing the work of Ezra,\u201d and making all arrangements for the safety and good government of the city. At the close of this important period of his public life, he returned to Persia to the service of his royal master at Shushan or Ecbatana. Very soon after this the old corrupt state of things returned, showing the worthlessness to a large extent of the professions that had been made at the feast of the dedication of the walls of the city ([Neh. 12](/neh#Neh.12). See EZRA). Malachi now appeared among the people with words of stern reproof and solemn warning; and Nehemiah again returned from Persia (after an absence of some two years), and was grieved to see the widespread moral degeneracy that had taken place during his absence. He set himself with vigour to rectify the flagrant abuses that had sprung up, and restored the orderly administration of public worship and the outward observance of the law of Moses. Of his subsequent history we know nothing. Probably he remained at his post as governor till his death (about B.C. 413) in a good old age. The place of his death and burial is, however, unknown. \u201cHe resembled Ezra in his fiery zeal, in his active spirit of enterprise, and in the piety of his life: but he was of a bluffer and a fiercer mood; he had less patience with transgressors; he was a man of action rather than a man of thought, and more inclined to use force than persuasion. His practical sagacity and high courage were very markedly shown in the arrangement with which he carried through the rebuilding of the wall and balked the cunning plans of the \u2018adversaries.\u2019 The piety of his heart, his deeply religious spirit and constant sense of communion with and absolute dependence upon God, are strikingly exhibited, first in the long prayer recorded in ch. 1:5-11, and secondly and most remarkably in what have been called his \u2018interjectional prayers\u2019, those short but moving addresses to Almighty God which occur so frequently in his writings, the instinctive outpouring of a heart deeply moved, but ever resting itself upon God, and looking to God alone for aid in trouble, for the frustration of evil designs, and for final reward and acceptance\u201d (Rawlinson). Nehemiah was the last of the governors sent from the Persian court. Judea after this was annexed to the satrapy of Coele-Syria, and was governed by the high priest under the jurisdiction of the governor of Syria, and the internal government of the country became more and more a hierarchy.",

From profane history and the inscriptions, we are led to conclude that he was the Neriglissar who murdered Evil-merodach, the son of Nebuchadnezzar, and succeeded him on the throne of Babylon (B.C. 559-556). He was married to a daughter of Nebuchadnezzar. The ruins of a palace, the only one on the right bank of the Euphrates, bear inscriptions denoting that it was built by this king. He was succeeded by his son, a mere boy, who was murdered after a reign of some nine months by a conspiracy of the nobles, one of whom, Nabonadius, ascended the vacant throne, and reigned for a period of seventeen years (B.C. 555-538), at the close of which period Babylon was taken by Cyrus. Belshazzar, who comes into notice in connection with the taking of Babylon, was by some supposed to have been the same as Nabonadius, who was called Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s son ([Dan. 5:11](/dan#Dan.5.11), [18](/dan#Dan.5.18), [22](/dan#Dan.5.22)), because he had married his daughter. But it is known from the inscriptions that Nabonadius had a son called Belshazzar, who may have been his father\u2019s associate on the throne at the time of the fall of Babylon, and who therefore would be the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar. The Jews had only one word, usually rendered \u201cfather,\u201d to represent also such a relationship as that of \u201cgrandfather\u201d or \u201cgreat-grandfather.\u201d",

Noah) the grandson of Methuselah ([Gen. 5:25-29](/gen#Gen.5.25)), who was for two hundred and fifty years contemporary with Adam, and the son of Lamech, who was about fifty years old at the time of Adam\u2019s death. This patriarch is rightly regarded as the connecting link between the old and the new world. He is the second great progenitor of the human family.\n\n The words of his father Lamech at his birth ([Gen. 5:29](/gen#Gen.5.29)) have been regarded as in a sense prophetical, designating Noah as a type of Him who is the true \u201crest and comfort\u201d of men under the burden of life ([Matt. 11:28](/matt#Matt.11.28)).\n\n He lived five hundred years, and then there were born unto him three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth ([Gen. 5:32](/gen#Gen.5.32)). He was a \u201cjust man and perfect in his generation,\u201d and \u201cwalked with God\u201d (comp. [Ezek. 14:14](/ezek#Ezek.14.14), [20](/ezek#Ezek.14.20)). But now the descendants of Cain and of Seth began to intermarry, and then there sprang up a race distinguished for their ungodliness. Men became more and more corrupt, and God determined to sweep the earth of its wicked population ([Gen. 6:7](/gen#Gen.6.7)). But with Noah God entered into a covenant, with a promise of deliverance from the threatened deluge (18). He was accordingly commanded to build an ark (6:14-16) for the saving of himself and his house. An interval of one hundred and twenty years elapsed while the ark was being built (6:3), during which Noah bore constant testimony against the unbelief and wickedness of that generation ([1 Pet. 3:18-20](/1pet#1Pet.3.18); 2 Pet. 2:5).\n\n When the ark of \u201cgopher-wood\u201d (mentioned only here) was at length completed according to the command of the Lord, the living creatures that were to be preserved entered into it; and then Noah and his wife and sons and daughters-in-law entered it, and the \u201cLord shut him in\u201d ([Gen. 7:16](/gen#Gen.7.16)). The judgment-threatened now fell on the guilty world, \u201cthe world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished\u201d (2 Pet. 3:6). The ark floated on the waters for one hundred and fifty days, and then rested on the mountains of Ararat ([Gen. 8:3](/gen#Gen.8.3), [4](/gen#Gen.8.4)); but not for a considerable time after this was divine permission given him to leave the ark, so that he and his family were a whole year shut up within it ([Gen. 6](/gen#Gen.6)-14).\n\n On leaving the ark Noah\u2019s first act was to erect an altar, the first of which there is any mention, and offer the sacrifices of adoring thanks and praise to God, who entered into a covenant with him, the first covenant between God and man, granting him possession of the earth by a new and special charter, which remains in force to the present time ([Gen. 8:21-9:17](/gen#Gen.8.21)). As a sign and witness of this covenant, the rainbow was adopted and set apart by God, as a sure pledge that never again would the earth be destroyed by a flood.\n\n But, alas! Noah after this fell into grievous sin ([Gen. 9:21](/gen#Gen.9.21)); and the conduct of Ham on this sad occasion led to the memorable prediction regarding his three sons and their descendants. Noah \u201clived after the flood three hundred and fifty years, and he died\u201d (28:29). (See DELUGE).\n\n Noah, motion, (Heb.

            "dictText": "=Saul (q.v.) was born about the same time as our Lord. His circumcision-name was Saul, and probably the name Paul was also given to him in infancy \u201cfor use in the Gentile world,\u201d as \u201cSaul\u201d would be his Hebrew home-name. He was a native of Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, a Roman province in the south-east of Asia Minor. That city stood on the banks of the river Cydnus, which was navigable thus far; hence it became a centre of extensive commercial traffic with many countries along the shores of the Mediterranean, as well as with the countries of central Asia Minor. It thus became a city distinguished for the wealth of its inhabitants.\n\n Tarsus was also the seat of a famous university, higher in reputation even than the universities of Athens and Alexandria, the only others that then existed. Here Saul was born, and here he spent his youth, doubtless enjoying the best education his native city could afford. His father was of the straitest sect of the Jews, a Pharisee, of the tribe of Benjamin, of pure and unmixed Jewish blood ([Acts 23:6](/acts#Acts.23.6); [Phil. 3:5](/phil#Phil.3.5)). We learn nothing regarding his mother; but there is reason to conclude that she was a pious woman, and that, like-minded with her husband, she exercised all a mother influence in moulding the character of her son, so that he could afterwards speak of himself as being, from his youth up, \u201ctouching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless\u201d ([Phil. 3:6](/phil#Phil.3.6)).\n\n We read of his sister and his sister\u2019s son ([Acts 23:16](/acts#Acts.23.16)), and of other relatives ([Rom. 16:7](/rom#Rom.16.7), [11](/rom#Rom.16.11), [12](/rom#Rom.16.12)). Though a Jew, his father was a Roman citizen. How he obtained this privilege we are not informed. \u201cIt might be bought, or won by distinguished service to the state, or acquired in several other ways; at all events, his son was freeborn. It was a valuable privilege, and one that was to prove of great use to Paul, although not in the way in which his father might have been expected to desire him to make use of it.\u201d Perhaps the most natural career for the youth to follow was that of a merchant. \u201cBut it was decided that...he should go to college and become a rabbi, that is, a minister, a teacher, and a lawyer all in one.\u201d\n\n According to Jewish custom, however, he learned a trade before entering on the more direct preparation for the sacred profession. The trade he acquired was the making of tents from goats\u2019 hair cloth, a trade which was one of the commonest in Tarsus.\n\n His preliminary education having been completed, Saul was sent, when about thirteen years of age probably, to the great Jewish school of sacred learning at Jerusalem as a student of the law. Here he became a pupil of the celebrated rabbi Gamaliel, and here he spent many years in an elaborate study of the Scriptures and of the many questions concerning them with which the rabbis exercised themselves. During these years of diligent study he lived \u201cin all good conscience,\u201d unstained by the vices of that great city.\n\n After the period of his student-life expired, he probably left Jerusalem for Tarsus, where he may have been engaged in connection with some synagogue for some years. But we find him back again at Jerusalem very soon after the death of our Lord. Here he now learned the particulars regarding the crucifixion, and the rise of the new sect of the \u201cNazarenes.\u201d\n\n For some two years after Pentecost, Christianity was quietly spreading its influence in Jerusalem. At length Stephen, one of the seven deacons, gave forth more public and aggressive testimony that Jesus was the Messiah, and this led to much excitement among the Jews and much disputation in their synagogues. Persecution arose against Stephen and the followers of Christ generally, in which Saul of Tarsus took a prominent part. He was at this time probably a member of the great Sanhedrin, and became the active leader in the furious persecution by which the rulers then sought to exterminate Christianity.\n\n But the object of this persecution also failed. \u201cThey that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word.\u201d The anger of the persecutor was thereby kindled into a fiercer flame. Hearing that fugitives had taken refuge in Damascus, he obtained from the chief priest letters authorizing him to proceed thither on his persecuting career. This was a long journey of about 130 miles, which would occupy perhaps six days, during which, with his few attendants, he steadily went onward, \u201cbreathing out threatenings and slaughter.\u201d But the crisis of his life was at hand. He had reached the last stage of his journey, and was within sight of Damascus. As he and his companions rode on, suddenly at mid-day a brilliant light shone round them, and Saul was laid prostrate in terror on the ground, a voice sounding in his ears, \u201cSaul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?\u201d The risen Saviour was there, clothed in the vesture of his glorified humanity. In answer to the anxious inquiry of the stricken persecutor, \u201cWho art thou, Lord?\u201d he said, \u201cI am Jesus whom thou persecutest\u201d ([Acts 9:5](/acts#Acts.9.5); [22:8](/acts#Acts.22.8); [26:15](/acts#Acts.26.15)).\n\n This was the moment of his conversion, the most solemn in all his life. Blinded by the dazzling light ([Acts 9:8](/acts#Acts.9.8)), his companions led him into the city, where, absorbed in deep thought for three days, he neither ate nor drank (9:11). Ananias, a disciple living in Damascus, was informed by a vision of the change that had happened to Saul, and was sent to him to open his eyes and admit him by baptism into the Christian church (9:11-16). The whole purpose of his life was now permanently changed.\n\n Immediately after his conversion he retired into the solitudes of Arabia ([Gal. 1:17](/gal#Gal.1.17)), perhaps of \u201cSinai in Arabia,\u201d for the purpose, probably, of devout study and meditation on the marvellous revelation that had been made to him. \u201cA veil of thick darkness hangs over this visit to Arabia. Of the scenes among which he moved, of the thoughts and occupations which engaged him while there, of all the circumstances of a crisis which must have shaped the whole tenor of his after-life, absolutely nothing is known. \u2018Immediately,\u2019 says St. Paul, \u2018I went away into Arabia.\u2019 The historian passes over the incident [comp. [Acts 9:23](/acts#Acts.9.23) and [1 Kings 11:38](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.38), [39](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.39)]. It is a mysterious pause, a moment of suspense, in the apostle\u2019s history, a breathless calm, which ushers in the tumultuous storm of his active missionary life.\u201d Coming back, after three years, to Damascus, he began to preach the gospel \u201cboldly in the name of Jesus\u201d ([Acts 9:27](/acts#Acts.9.27)), but was soon obliged to flee (9:25; [2 Cor. 11:33](/2cor#2Cor.11.33)) from the Jews and betake himself to Jerusalem. Here he tarried for three weeks, but was again forced to flee ([Acts 9:28](/acts#Acts.9.28), [29](/acts#Acts.9.29)) from persecution. He now returned to his native Tarsus ([Gal. 1:21](/gal#Gal.1.21)), where, for probably about three years, we lose sight of him. The time had not yet come for his entering on his great life-work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles.\n\n At length the city of Antioch, the capital of Syria, became the scene of great Christian activity. There the gospel gained a firm footing, and the cause of Christ prospered. Barnabas (q.v.), who had been sent from Jerusalem to superintend the work at Antioch, found it too much for him, and remembering Saul, he set out to Tarsus to seek for him. He readily responded to the call thus addressed to him, and came down to Antioch, which for \u201ca whole year\u201d became the scene of his labours, which were crowned with great success. The disciples now, for the first time, were called \u201cChristians\u201d ([Acts 11:26](/acts#Acts.11.26)).\n\n The church at Antioch now proposed to send out missionaries to the Gentiles, and Saul and Barnabas, with John Mark as their attendant, were chosen for this work. This was a great epoch in the history of the church. Now the disciples began to give effect to the Master\u2019s command: \u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.\u201d\n\n The three missionaries went forth on the first missionary tour. They sailed from Seleucia, the seaport of Antioch, across to Cyprus, some 80 miles to the south-west. Here at Paphos, Sergius Paulus, the Roman proconsul, was converted, and now Saul took the lead, and was ever afterwards called Paul. The missionaries now crossed to the mainland, and then proceeded 6 or 7 miles up the river Cestrus to Perga ([Acts 13:13](/acts#Acts.13.13)), where John Mark deserted the work and returned to Jerusalem. The two then proceeded about 100 miles inland, passing through Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The towns mentioned in this tour are the Pisidian Antioch, where Paul delivered his first address of which we have any record (13:16-51; comp. 10:30-43), Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. They returned by the same route to see and encourage the converts they had made, and ordain elders in every city to watch over the churches which had been gathered. From Perga they sailed direct for Antioch, from which they had set out.\n\n After remaining \u201ca long time\u201d, probably till A.D. 50 or 51, in Antioch, a great controversy broke out in the church there regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law. For the purpose of obtaining a settlement of this question, Paul and Barnabas were sent as deputies to consult the church at Jerusalem. The council or synod which was there held ([Acts 15](/acts#Acts.15)) decided against the Judaizing party; and the deputies, accompanied by Judas and Silas, returned to Antioch, bringing with them the decree of the council.\n\n After a short rest at Antioch, Paul said to Barnabas: \u201cLet us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they do.\u201d Mark proposed again to accompany them; but Paul refused to allow him to go. Barnabas was resolved to take Mark, and thus he and Paul had a sharp contention. They separated, and never again met. Paul, however, afterwards speaks with honour of Barnabas, and sends for Mark to come to him at Rome ([Col. 4:10](/col#Col.4.10); [2 Tim. 4:11](/2tim#2Tim.4.11)).\n\n Paul took with him Silas, instead of Barnabas, and began his second missionary journey about A.D. 51. This time he went by land, revisiting the churches he had already founded in Asia. But he longed to enter into \u201cregions beyond,\u201d and still went forward through Phrygia and Galatia (16:6). Contrary to his intention, he was constrained to linger in Galatia (q.v.), on account of some bodily affliction ([Gal. 4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13), [14](/gal#Gal.4.14)). Bithynia, a populous province on the shore of the Black Sea, lay now before him, and he wished to enter it; but the way was shut, the Spirit in some manner guiding him in another direction, till he came down to the shores of the AEgean and arrived at Troas, on the north-western coast of Asia Minor ([Acts 16:8](/acts#Acts.16.8)). Of this long journey from Antioch to Troas we have no account except some references to it in his Epistle to the Galatians (4:13).\n\n As he waited at Troas for indications of the will of God as to his future movements, he saw, in the vision of the night, a man from the opposite shores of Macedonia standing before him, and heard him cry, \u201cCome over, and help us\u201d ([Acts 16:9](/acts#Acts.16.9)). Paul recognized in this vision a message from the Lord, and the very next day set sail across the Hellespont, which separated him from Europe, and carried the tidings of the gospel into the Western world. In Macedonia, churches were planted in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea. Leaving this province, Paul passed into Achaia, \u201cthe paradise of genius and renown.\u201d He reached Athens, but quitted it after, probably, a brief sojourn (17:17-31). The Athenians had received him with cold disdain, and he never visited that city again. He passed over to Corinth, the seat of the Roman government of Achaia, and remained there a year and a half, labouring with much success. While at Corinth, he wrote his two epistles to the church of Thessalonica, his earliest apostolic letters, and then sailed for Syria, that he might be in time to keep the feast of Pentecost at Jerusalem. He was accompanied by Aquila and Priscilla, whom he left at Ephesus, at which he touched, after a voyage of thirteen or fifteen days. He landed at Caesarea, and went up to Jerusalem, and having \u201csaluted the church\u201d there, and kept the feast, he left for Antioch, where he abode \u201csome time\u201d ([Acts 18:20-23](/acts#Acts.18.20)).\n\n He then began his third missionary tour. He journeyed by land in the \u201cupper coasts\u201d (the more eastern parts) of Asia Minor, and at length made his way to Ephesus, where he tarried for no less than three years, engaged in ceaseless Christian labour. \u201cThis city was at the time the Liverpool of the Mediterranean. It possessed a splendid harbour, in which was concentrated the traffic of the sea which was then the highway of the nations; and as Liverpool has behind her the great towns of Lancashire, so had Ephesus behind and around her such cities as those mentioned along with her in the epistles to the churches in the book of Revelation, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea. It was a city of vast wealth, and it was given over to every kind of pleasure, the fame of its theatres and race-course being world-wide\u201d (Stalker\u2019s Life of St. Paul). Here a \u201cgreat door and effectual\u201d was opened to the apostle. His fellow-labourers aided him in his work, carrying the gospel to Colosse and Laodicea and other places which they could reach.\n\n Very shortly before his departure from Ephesus, the apostle wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians (q.v.). The silversmiths, whose traffic in the little images which they made was in danger (see DEMETRIUS), organized a riot against Paul, and he left the city, and proceeded to Troas ([2 Cor. 2:12](/2cor#2Cor.2.12)), whence after some time he went to meet Titus in Macedonia. Here, in consequence of the report Titus brought from Corinth, he wrote his second epistle to that church. Having spent probably most of the summer and autumn in Macedonia, visiting the churches there, specially the churches of Philippi, Thessalonica, and Berea, probably penetrating into the interior, to the shores of the Adriatic ([Rom. 15:19](/rom#Rom.15.19)), he then came into Greece, where he abode three month, spending probably the greater part of this time in Corinth ([Acts 20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2)). During his stay in this city he wrote his Epistle to the Galatians, and also the great Epistle to the Romans. At the end of the three months he left Achaia for Macedonia, thence crossed into Asia Minor, and touching at Miletus, there addressed the Ephesian presbyters, whom he had sent for to meet him ([Acts 20:17](/acts#Acts.20.17)), and then sailed for Tyre, finally reaching Jerusalem, probably in the spring of A.D. 58.\n\n While at Jerusalem, at the feast of Pentecost, he was almost murdered by a Jewish mob in the temple. (See  TEMPLE, HEROD\u2019S.)  Rescued from their violence by the Roman commandant, he was conveyed as a prisoner to Caesarea, where, from various causes, he was detained a prisoner for two years in Herod\u2019s praetorium ([Acts 23:35](/acts#Acts.23.35)). \u201cPaul was not kept in close confinement; he had at least the range of the barracks in which he was detained. There we can imagine him pacing the ramparts on the edge of the Mediterranean, and gazing wistfully across the blue waters in the direction of Macedonia, Achaia, and Ephesus, where his spiritual children were pining for him, or perhaps encountering dangers in which they sorely needed his presence. It was a mysterious providence which thus arrested his energies and condemned the ardent worker to inactivity; yet we can now see the reason for it. Paul was needing rest. After twenty years of incessant evangelization, he required leisure to garner the harvest of experience...During these two years he wrote nothing; it was a time of internal mental activity and silent progress\u201d (Stalker\u2019s Life of St. Paul).\n\n At the end of these two years Felix (q.v.) was succeeded in the governorship of Palestine by Porcius Festus, before whom the apostle was again heard. But judging it right at this crisis to claim the privilege of a Roman citizen, he appealed to the emperor ([Acts 25:11](/acts#Acts.25.11)). Such an appeal could not be disregarded, and Paul was at once sent on to Rome under the charge of one Julius, a centurion of the \u201cAugustan cohort.\u201d After a long and perilous voyage, he at length reached the imperial city in the early spring, probably, of A.D. 61. Here he was permitted to occupy his own hired house, under constant military custody. This privilege was accorded to him, no doubt, because he was a Roman citizen, and as such could not be put into prison without a trial. The soldiers who kept guard over Paul were of course changed at frequent intervals, and thus he had the opportunity of preaching the gospel to many of them during these \u201ctwo whole years,\u201d and with the blessed result of spreading among the imperial guards, and even in Caesar\u2019s household, an interest in the truth ([Phil. 1:13](/phil#Phil.1.13)). His rooms were resorted to by many anxious inquirers, both Jews and Gentiles ([Acts 28:23](/acts#Acts.28.23), [30](/acts#Acts.28.30), [31](/acts#Acts.28.31)), and thus his imprisonment \u201cturned rather to the furtherance of the gospel,\u201d and his \u201chired house\u201d became the centre of a gracious influence which spread over the whole city. According to a Jewish tradition, it was situated on the borders of the modern Ghetto, which has been the Jewish quarters in Rome from the time of Pompey to the present day. During this period the apostle wrote his epistles to the Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, and to Philemon, and probably also to the Hebrews.\n\n This first imprisonment came at length to a close, Paul having been acquitted, probably because no witnesses appeared against him. Once more he set out on his missionary labours, probably visiting western and eastern Europe and Asia Minor. During this period of freedom he wrote his First Epistle to Timothy and his Epistle to Titus. The year of his release was signalized by the burning of Rome, which Nero saw fit to attribute to the Christians. A fierce persecution now broke out against the Christians. Paul was siezed, and once more conveyed to Rome a prisoner. During this imprisonment he probably wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy, the last he ever wrote. \u201cThere can be little doubt that he appered again at Nero\u2019s bar, and this time the charge did not break down. In all history there is not a more startling illustration of the irony of human life than this scene of Paul at the bar of Nero. On the judgment-seat, clad in the imperial purple, sat a man who, in a bad world, had attained the eminence of being the very worst and meanest being in it, a man stained with every crime, a man whose whole being was so steeped in every nameable and unnameable vice, that body and soul of him were, as some one said at the time, nothing but a compound of mud and blood; and in the prisoner\u2019s dock stood the best man the world possessed, his hair whitened with labours for the good of men and the glory of God. The trial ended: Paul was condemned, and delivered over to the executioner. He was led out of the city, with a crowd of the lowest rabble at his heels. The fatal spot was reached; he knelt beside the block; the headsman\u2019s axe gleamed in the sun and fell; and the head of the apostle of the world rolled down in the dust\u201d (probably A.D. 66), four years before the fall of Jerusalem.",

            "dictText": "Originally called Simon (=Simeon, i.e., \u201chearing\u201d), a very common Jewish name in the New Testament. He was the son of Jona ([Matt. 16:17](/matt#Matt.16.17)). His mother is nowhere named in Scripture. He had a younger brother called Andrew, who first brought him to Jesus ([John 1:40-42](/john#John.1.40)). His native town was Bethsaida, on the western coast of the Sea of Galilee, to which also Philip belonged. Here he was brought up by the shores of the Sea of Galilee, and was trained to the occupation of a fisher. His father had probably died while he was still young, and he and his brother were brought up under the care of Zebedee and his wife Salome ([Matt. 27:56](/matt#Matt.27.56); [Mark 15:40](/mark#Mark.15.40); [16:1](/mark#Mark.16.1)). There the four youths, Simon, Andrew, James, and John, spent their boyhood and early manhood in constant fellowship. Simon and his brother doubtless enjoyed all the advantages of a religious training, and were early instructed in an acquaintance with the Scriptures and with the great prophecies regarding the coming of the Messiah. They did not probably enjoy, however, any special training in the study of the law under any of the rabbis. When Peter appeared before the Sanhedrin, he looked like an \u201cunlearned man\u201d ([Acts 4:13](/acts#Acts.4.13)).\n\n \u201cSimon was a Galilean, and he was that out and out...The Galileans had a marked character of their own. They had a reputation for an independence and energy which often ran out into turbulence. They were at the same time of a franker and more transparent disposition than their brethren in the south. In all these respects, in bluntness, impetuosity, headiness, and simplicity, Simon was a genuine Galilean. They spoke a peculiar dialect. They had a difficulty with the guttural sounds and some others, and their pronunciation was reckoned harsh in Judea. The Galilean accent stuck to Simon all through his career. It betrayed him as a follower of Christ when he stood within the judgment-hall ([Mark 14:70](/mark#Mark.14.70)). It betrayed his own nationality and that of those conjoined with him on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:7](/acts#Acts.2.7)).\u201d It would seem that Simon was married before he became an apostle. His wife\u2019s mother is referred to ([Matt. 8:14](/matt#Matt.8.14); [Mark 1:30](/mark#Mark.1.30); [Luke 4:38](/luke#Luke.4.38)). He was in all probability accompanied by his wife on his missionary journeys ([1 Cor. 9:5](/1cor#1Cor.9.5); comp. [1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)).\n\n He appears to have been settled at Capernaum when Christ entered on his public ministry, and may have reached beyond the age of thirty. His house was large enough to give a home to his brother Andrew, his wife\u2019s mother, and also to Christ, who seems to have lived with him ([Mark 1:29](/mark#Mark.1.29), [36](/mark#Mark.1.36); 2:1), as well as to his own family. It was apparently two stories high (2:4).\n\n At Bethabara (R.V., [John 1:28](/john#John.1.28), \u201cBethany\u201d), beyond Jordan, John the Baptist had borne testimony concerning Jesus as the \u201cLamb of God\u201d ([John 1:29-36](/john#John.1.29)). Andrew and John hearing it, followed Jesus, and abode with him where he was. They were convinced, by his gracious words and by the authority with which he spoke, that he was the Messiah ([Luke 4:22](/luke#Luke.4.22); [Matt. 7:29](/matt#Matt.7.29)); and Andrew went forth and found Simon and brought him to Jesus ([John 1:41](/john#John.1.41)).\n\n Jesus at once recognized Simon, and declared that hereafter he would be called Cephas, an Aramaic name corresponding to the Greek Petros, which means \u201ca mass of rock detached from the living rock.\u201d The Aramaic name does not occur again, but the name Peter gradually displaces the old name Simon, though our Lord himself always uses the name Simon when addressing him ([Matt. 17:25](/matt#Matt.17.25); [Mark 14:37](/mark#Mark.14.37); [Luke 22:31](/luke#Luke.22.31), comp. 21:15-17). We are not told what impression the first interview with Jesus produced on the mind of Simon. When we next meet him it is by the Sea of Galilee ([Matt. 4:18-22](/matt#Matt.4.18)). There the four (Simon and Andrew, James and John) had had an unsuccessful night\u2019s fishing. Jesus appeared suddenly, and entering into Simon\u2019s boat, bade him launch forth and let down the nets. He did so, and enclosed a great multitude of fishes. This was plainly a miracle wrought before Simon\u2019s eyes. The awe-stricken disciple cast himself at the feet of Jesus, crying, \u201cDepart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord\u201d ([Luke 5:8](/luke#Luke.5.8)). Jesus addressed him with the assuring words, \u201cFear not,\u201d and announced to him his life\u2019s work. Simon responded at once to the call to become a disciple, and after this we find him in constant attendance on our Lord.\n\n He is next called into the rank of the apostleship, and becomes a \u201cfisher of men\u201d ([Matt. 4:19](/matt#Matt.4.19)) in the stormy seas of the world of human life ([Matt. 10:2-4](/matt#Matt.10.2); [Mark 3:13-19](/mark#Mark.3.13); [Luke 6:13-16](/luke#Luke.6.13)), and takes a more and more prominent part in all the leading events of our Lord\u2019s life. It is he who utters that notable profession of faith at Capernaum ([John 6:66-69](/john#John.6.66)), and again at Caesarea Philippi ([Matt. 16:13-20](/matt#Matt.16.13); [Mark 8:27-30](/mark#Mark.8.27); [Luke 9:18-20](/luke#Luke.9.18)). This profession at Caesarea was one of supreme importance, and our Lord in response used these memorable words: \u201cThou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.\u201d\n\n \u201cFrom that time forth\u201d Jesus began to speak of his sufferings. For this Peter rebuked him. But our Lord in return rebuked Peter, speaking to him in sterner words than he ever used to any other of his disciples ([Matt. 16:21-23](/matt#Matt.16.21); [Mark 8:31-33](/mark#Mark.8.31)). At the close of his brief sojourn at Caesarea our Lord took Peter and James and John with him into \u201can high mountain apart,\u201d and was transfigured before them. Peter on that occasion, under the impression the scene produced on his mind, exclaimed, \u201cLord, it is good for us to be here: let us make three tabernacles\u201d ([Matt. 17:1-9](/matt#Matt.17.1)).\n\n On his return to Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax (a didrachma, half a sacred shekel), which every Israelite of twenty years old and upwards had to pay ([Ex. 30:15](/exod#Exod.30.15)), came to Peter and reminded him that Jesus had not paid it ([Matt. 17:24-27](/matt#Matt.17.24)). Our Lord instructed Peter to go and catch a fish in the lake and take from its mouth the exact amount needed for the tax, viz., a stater, or two half-shekels. \u201cThat take,\u201d said our Lord, \u201cand give unto them for me and thee.\u201d\n\n As the end was drawing nigh, our Lord sent Peter and John ([Luke 22:7-13](/luke#Luke.22.7)) into the city to prepare a place where he should keep the feast with his disciples. There he was forewarned of the fearful sin into which he afterwards fell (22:31-34). He accompanied our Lord from the guest-chamber to the garden of Gethsemane ([Luke 22:39-46](/luke#Luke.22.39)), which he and the other two who had been witnesses of the transfiguration were permitted to enter with our Lord, while the rest were left without. Here he passed through a strange experience. Under a sudden impulse he cut off the ear of Malchus (47-51), one of the band that had come forth to take Jesus. Then follow the scenes of the judgment-hall (54-61) and his bitter grief (62).\n\n He is found in John\u2019s company early on the morning of the resurrection. He boldly entered into the empty grave ([John 20:1-10](/john#John.20.1)), and saw the \u201clinen clothes laid by themselves\u201d ([Luke 24:9-12](/luke#Luke.24.9)). To him, the first of the apostles, our risen Lord revealed himself, thus conferring on him a signal honour, and showing how fully he was restored to his favour ([Luke 24:34](/luke#Luke.24.34); [1 Cor. 15:5](/1cor#1Cor.15.5)). We next read of our Lord\u2019s singular interview with Peter on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, where he thrice asked him, \u201cSimon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?\u201d ([John 21:1-19](/john#John.21.1)). (See LOVE.)\n\n After this scene at the lake we hear nothing of Peter till he again appears with the others at the ascension ([Acts 1:15-26](/acts#Acts.1.15)). It was he who proposed that the vacancy caused by the apostasy of Judas should be filled up. He is prominent on the day of Pentecost (2:14-40). The events of that day \u201ccompleted the change in Peter himself which the painful discipline of his fall and all the lengthened process of previous training had been slowly making. He is now no more the unreliable, changeful, self-confident man, ever swaying between rash courage and weak timidity, but the stead-fast, trusted guide and director of the fellowship of believers, the intrepid preacher of Christ in Jerusalem and abroad. And now that he is become Cephas indeed, we hear almost nothing of the name Simon (only in [Acts 10:5](/acts#Acts.10.5), [32](/acts#Acts.10.32); 15:14), and he is known to us finally as Peter.\u201d\n\n After the miracle at the temple gate ([Acts 3](/acts#Acts.3)) persecution arose against the Christians, and Peter was cast into prison. He boldly defended himself and his companions at the bar of the council (4:19, 20). A fresh outburst of violence against the Christians (5:17-21) led to the whole body of the apostles being cast into prison; but during the night they were wonderfully delivered, and were found in the morning teaching in the temple. A second time Peter defended them before the council ([Acts 5:29-32](/acts#Acts.5.29)), who, \u201cwhen they had called the apostles and beaten them, let them go.\u201d\n\n The time had come for Peter to leave Jerusalem. After labouring for some time in Samaria, he returned to Jerusalem, and reported to the church there the results of his work ([Acts 8:14-25](/acts#Acts.8.14)). Here he remained for a period, during which he met Paul for the first time since his conversion (9:26-30; [Gal. 1:18](/gal#Gal.1.18)). Leaving Jerusalem again, he went forth on a missionary journey to Lydda and Joppa ([Acts 9:32-43](/acts#Acts.9.32)). He is next called on to open the door of the Christian church to the Gentiles by the admission of Cornelius of Caesarea (ch. 10).\n\n After remaining for some time at Caesarea, he returned to Jerusalem ([Acts 11:1-18](/acts#Acts.11.1)), where he defended his conduct with reference to the Gentiles. Next we hear of his being cast into prison by Herod Agrippa (12:1-19); but in the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison gates, and he went forth and found refuge in the house of Mary.\n\n He took part in the deliberations of the council in Jerusalem ([Acts 15:1-31](/acts#Acts.15.1); [Gal. 2:1-10](/gal#Gal.2.1)) regarding the relation of the Gentiles to the church. This subject had awakened new interest at Antioch, and for its settlement was referred to the council of the apostles and elders at Jerusalem. Here Paul and Peter met again.\n\n We have no further mention of Peter in the Acts of the Apostles. He seems to have gone down to Antioch after the council at Jerusalem, and there to have been guilty of dissembling, for which he was severely reprimanded by Paul ([Gal. 2:11-16](/gal#Gal.2.11)), who \u201crebuked him to his face.\u201d\n\n After this he appears to have carried the gospel to the east, and to have laboured for a while at Babylon, on the Euphrates ([1 Pet. 5:13](/1pet#1Pet.5.13)). There is no satisfactory evidence that he was ever at Rome. Where or when he died is not certainly known. Probably he died between A.D. 64 and 67.",

Recent discoveries, however, have led to the conclusion that Seti was the \u201cnew king.\u201d\n\n For about seventy years the Hebrews in Egypt were under the powerful protection of Joseph. After his death their condition was probably very slowly and gradually changed. The invaders, the Hyksos, who for some five centuries had been masters of Egypt, were driven out, and the old dynasty restored. The Israelites now began to be looked down upon. They began to be afflicted and tyrannized over. In process of time a change appears to have taken place in the government of Egypt. A new dynasty, the Nineteenth, as it is called, came into power under Seti I., who was its founder. He associated with him in his government his son, Rameses II., when he was yet young, probably ten or twelve years of age.\n\n Note, Professor Maspero, keeper of the museum of Bulak, near Cairo, had his attention in 1870 directed to the fact that scarabs, i.e., stone and metal imitations of the beetle (symbols of immortality), originally worn as amulets by royal personages, which were evidently genuine relics of the time of the ancient Pharaohs, were being sold at Thebes and different places along the Nile. This led him to suspect that some hitherto undiscovered burial-place of the Pharaohs had been opened, and that these and other relics, now secretly sold, were a part of the treasure found there. For a long time he failed, with all his ingenuity, to find the source of these rare treasures. At length one of those in the secret volunteered to give information regarding this burial-place. The result was that a party was conducted in 1881 to Dier el-Bahari, near Thebes, when the wonderful discovery was made of thirty-six mummies of kings, queens, princes, and high priests hidden away in a cavern prepared for them, where they had lain undisturbed for thirty centuries. \u201cThe temple of Deir el-Bahari stands in the middle of a natural amphitheatre of cliffs, which is only one of a number of smaller amphitheatres into which the limestone mountains of the tombs are broken up. In the wall of rock separating this basin from the one next to it some ancient Egyptian engineers had constructed the hiding-place, whose secret had been kept for nearly three thousand years.\u201d The exploring party being guided to the place, found behind a great rock a shaft 6 feet square and about 40 feet deep, sunk into the limestone. At the bottom of this a passage led westward for 25 feet, and then turned sharply northward into the very heart of the mountain, where in a chamber 23 feet by 13, and 6 feet in height, they came upon the wonderful treasures of antiquity. The mummies were all carefully secured and brought down to Bulak, where they were deposited in the royal museum, which has now been removed to Ghizeh.\n\n Among the most notable of the ancient kings of Egypt thus discovered were Thothmes III., Seti I., and Rameses II. Thothmes III. was the most distinguished monarch of the brilliant Eighteenth Dynasty. When this mummy was unwound \u201conce more, after an interval of thirty-six centuries, human eyes gazed on the features of the man who had conquered Syria and Cyprus and Ethiopia, and had raised Egypt to the highest pinnacle of her power. The spectacle, however, was of brief duration. The remains proved to be in so fragile a state that there was only time to take a hasty photograph, and then the features crumbled to pieces and vanished like an apparition, and so passed away from human view for ever.\u201d \u201cIt seems strange that though the body of this man,\u201d who overran Palestine with his armies two hundred years before the birth of Moses, \u201cmouldered to dust, the flowers with which it had been wreathed were so wonderfully preserved that even their colour could be distinguished\u201d (Manning\u2019s Land of the Pharaohs).\n\n Seti I. (his throne name Merenptah), the father of Rameses II., was a great and successful warrior, also a great builder. The mummy of this Pharaoh, when unrolled, brought to view \u201cthe most beautiful mummy head ever seen within the walls of the museum. The sculptors of Thebes and Abydos did not flatter this Pharaoh when they gave him that delicate, sweet, and smiling profile which is the admiration of travellers. After a lapse of thirty-two centuries, the mummy retains the same expression which characterized the features of the living man. Most remarkable of all, when compared with the mummy of Rameses II., is the striking resemblance between the father and the son. Seti I. is, as it were, the idealized type of Rameses II. He must have died at an advanced age. The head is shaven, the eyebrows are white, the condition of the body points to considerably more than threescore years of life, thus confirming the opinions of the learned, who have attributed a long reign to this king.\u201d",

Some think the balance of evidence to be in favour of the former, whose reign it is known began peacefully, but came to a sudden and disastrous end. The \u201cHarris papyrus,\u201d found at Medinet-Abou in Upper Egypt in 1856, a state document written by Rameses III., the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, gives at length an account of a great exodus from Egypt, followed by wide-spread confusion and anarchy. This, there is great reason to believe, was the Hebrew exodus, with which the Nineteenth Dynasty of the Pharaohs came to an end. This period of anarchy was brought to a close by Setnekht, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.\n\n \u201cIn the spring of 1896, Professor Flinders Petrie discovered, among the ruins of the temple of Menephtah at Thebes, a large granite stela, on which is engraved a hymn of victory commemorating the defeat of Libyan invaders who had overrun the Delta. At the end other victories of Menephtah are glanced at, and it is said that \u2018the Israelites (I-s-y-r-a-e-l-u) are minished (?) so that they have no seed.\u2019 Menephtah was son and successor of Rameses II., the builder of Pithom, and Egyptian scholars have long seen in him the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The Exodus is also placed in his reign by the Egyptian legend of the event preserved by the historian Manetho. In the inscription the name of the Israelites has no determinative of \u2018country\u2019 or \u2019district\u2019 attached to it, as is the case with all the other names (Canaan, Ashkelon, Gezer, Khar or Southern Palestine, etc.) mentioned along with it, and it would therefore appear that at the time the hymn was composed, the Israelites had already been lost to the sight of the Egyptians in the desert. At all events they must have had as yet no fixed home or district of their own. We may therefore see in the reference to them the Pharaoh\u2019s version of the Exodus, the disasters which befell the Egyptians being naturally passed over in silence, and only the destruction of the \u2018men children\u2019 of the Israelites being recorded. The statement of the Egyptian poet is a remarkable parallel to [Ex. 1:10-22](/exod#Exod.1.10).\u201d",

Philip entered into conversation with him, and expounded these verses, preaching to him the glad tidings of the Saviour.

            "dictText": "Probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called \u201cPilate\u201d from the Latin pileatus, i.e., \u201cwearing the pileus\u201d, which was the \u201ccap or badge of a manumitted slave,\u201d as indicating that he was a \u201cfreedman,\u201d or the descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a \u201ctypical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.\u201d\n\n After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod\u2019s palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a \u201cmalefactor.\u201d Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king ([Luke 23:2](/luke#Luke.23.2)). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace ([John 18:33](/john#John.18.33)) and examined him in private (37, 38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus ([Luke 23:4](/luke#Luke.23.4)). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace \u201cthroughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee.\u201d When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (23:11, 12).\n\n Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision ([Matt. 27:19](/matt#Matt.27.19)). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the \u201cjust person.\u201d Pilate\u2019s feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, \u201cNot this man, but Barabbas.\u201d Pilate answered, \u201cWhat then shall I do with Jesus?\u201d The fierce cry immediately followed. \u201cLet him be crucified.\u201d Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, \u201cWhy, what evil hath he done?\u201d but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, \u201cAway with him! crucify him, crucify him!\u201d Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state ([Matt. 27:28](/matt#Matt.27.28); [John 19:2](/john#John.19.2)), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.\n\n Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium ([Matt. 27:27](/matt#Matt.27.27)) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, \u201cBehold the man!\u201d But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, \u201cCrucify him, crucify him!\u201d and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be \u201cthe Son of God.\u201d Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, \u201cWhence art thou?\u201d Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, \u201cKnowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?\u201d Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, \u201cThou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\u201d\n\n After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, \u201cIf thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u2019s friend.\u201d This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, \u201cI am innocent of the blood of this just person.\u201d The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children.\u201d Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, \u201cShall I crucify your King?\u201d The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, \u201cWe have no king but Caesar;\u201d and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.\n\n By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate\u2019s name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (3:13; 4:27; 13:28), and in [1 Tim. 6:13](/1tim#1Tim.6.13). In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.",

He was the founder of what is called the second Assyrian empire. He consolidated and organized his conquests on a large scale. He subdued Northern Syria and Hamath, and the kings of Syria rendered him homage and paid him tribute. His ambition was to found in Western Asia a kingdom which should embrace the whole civilized world, having Nineveh as its centre. Menahem, king of Israel, gave him the enormous tribute of a thousand talents of silver, \u201cthat his hand might be with him\u201d ([2 Kings 15:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.19); [1 Chr. 5:26](/1chr#1Chr.5.26)). The fact that this tribute could be paid showed the wealthy condition of the little kingdom of Israel even in this age of disorder and misgovernment.

The Babylonian king was slain, and Babylon and other Chaldean cities were taken, and Pul assumed the title of \u201cKing of Sumer [i.e., Shinar] and Accad.\u201d He was succeeded by Shalmanezer IV.",

Afterwards, on Jacob\u2019s departure from Mesopotamia, she took with her her father\u2019s teraphim (31:34, 35).

When the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim, in the \u201cArabah\u201d or Jordan valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to \u201cspy the land.\u201d After five days they returned, having swum across the river, which at this season, the month Abib, overflowed its banks from the melting of the snow on Lebanon. The spies reported how it had fared with them ([Josh. 2:1-7](/josh#Josh.2.1)). They had been exposed to danger in Jericho, and had been saved by the fidelity of Rahab the harlot, to whose house they had gone for protection. When the city of Jericho fell (6:17-25), Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies, and were incorporated among the Jewish people. She afterwards became the wife of Salmon, a prince of the tribe of Judah ([Ruth 4:21](/ruth#Ruth.4.21); [1 Chr. 2:11](/1chr#1Chr.2.11); [Matt. 1:5](/matt#Matt.1.5)). \u201cRahab\u2019s being asked to bring out the spies to the soldiers ([Josh. 2:3](/josh#Josh.2.3)) sent for them, is in strict keeping with Eastern manners, which would not permit any man to enter a woman\u2019s house without her permission. The fact of her covering the spies with bundles of flax which lay on her house-roof (2:6) is an \u2018undesigned coincidence\u2019 which strictly corroborates the narrative. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then\u201d (Geikie\u2019s Hours, etc., ii., 390).",

            "dictText": "He enlarges the people, the successor of Solomon on the throne, and apparently his only son. He was the son of Naamah \u201cthe Ammonitess,\u201d some well-known Ammonitish princess ([1 Kings 14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21); [2 Chr. 12:13](/2chr#2Chr.12.13)). He was forty-one years old when he ascended the throne, and he reigned seventeen years (B.C. 975-958). Although he was acknowledged at once as the rightful heir to the throne, yet there was a strongly-felt desire to modify the character of the government. The burden of taxation to which they had been subjected during Solomon\u2019s reign was very oppressive, and therefore the people assembled at Shechem and demanded from the king an alleviation of their burdens. He went to meet them at Shechem, and heard their demands for relief ([1 Kings 12:4](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.4)). After three days, having consulted with a younger generation of courtiers that had grown up around him, instead of following the advice of elders, he answered the people haughtily (6-15). \u201cThe king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the Lord\u201d (comp. 11:31). This brought matters speedily to a crisis. The terrible cry was heard (comp. [2 Sam. 20:1](/2sam#2Sam.20.1)):\n\n \u201cWhat portion have we in David?  Neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse:  To your tents, O Israel:  Now see to thine own house, David\u201d ([1 Kings 12:16](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.16)).\n\n And now at once the kingdom was rent in twain. Rehoboam was appalled, and tried concessions, but it was too late (18). The tribe of Judah, Rehoboam\u2019s own tribe, alone remained faithful to him. Benjamin was reckoned along with Judah, and these two tribes formed the southern kingdom, with Jerusalem as its capital; while the northern ten tribes formed themselves into a separate kingdom, choosing Jeroboam as their king. Rehoboam tried to win back the revolted ten tribes by making war against them, but he was prevented by the prophet Shemaiah (21-24; [2 Chr. 11:1-4](/2chr#2Chr.11.1)) from fulfilling his purpose. (See JEROBOAM.)\n\n In the fifth year of Rehoboam\u2019s reign, Shishak (q.v.), one of the kings of Egypt of the Assyrian dynasty, stirred up, no doubt, by Jeroboam his son-in-law, made war against him. Jerusalem submitted to the invader, who plundered the temple and virtually reduced the kingdom to the position of a vassal of Egypt ([1 Kings 14:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.25), [26](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.26); [2 Chr. 12:5-9](/2chr#2Chr.12.5)). A remarkable memorial of this invasion has been discovered at Karnac, in Upper Egypt, in certain sculptures on the walls of a small temple there. These sculptures represent the king, Shishak, holding in his hand a train of prisoners and other figures, with the names of the captured towns of Judah, the towns which Rehoboam had fortified ([2 Chr. 11:5-12](/2chr#2Chr.11.5)).\n\n The kingdom of Judah, under Rehoboam, sank more and more in moral and spiritual decay. \u201cThere was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.\u201d At length, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, Rehoboam \u201cslept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David\u201d ([1 Kings 14:31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)). He was succeeded by his son Abijah. (See EGYPT.)",

David accordingly delivered up to them the two sons of Rizpah and five of the sons of Merab (q.v.), Saul\u2019s eldest daughter, whom she bore to Adriel. These the Gibeonites put to death, and hung up their bodies before the Lord at the sanctuary at Gibeah.

The first recorded event of his life was his marriage with a Philistine woman of Timnath ([Judg. 14:1-5](/judg#Judg.14.1)). Such a marriage was not forbidden by the law of Moses, as the Philistines did not form one of the seven doomed Canaanite nations ([Ex. 34:11-16](/exod#Exod.34.11); [Deut. 7:1-4](/deut#Deut.7.1)). It was, however, an ill-assorted and unblessed marriage. His wife was soon taken from him and given \u201cto his companion\u201d ([Judg. 14:20](/judg#Judg.14.20)). For this Samson took revenge by burning the \u201cstanding corn of the Philistines\u201d (15:1-8), who, in their turn, in revenge \u201cburnt her and her father with fire.\u201d Her death he terribly avenged (15:7-19). During the twenty years following this he judged Israel; but we have no record of his life. Probably these twenty years may have been simultaneous with the last twenty years of Eli\u2019s life. After this we have an account of his exploits at Gaza (16:1-3), and of his infatuation for Delilah, and her treachery (16:4-20), and then of his melancholy death (16:21-31). He perished in the last terrible destruction he brought upon his enemies. \u201cSo the dead which he slew at his death were more [in social and political importance=the elite of the people] than they which he slew in his life.\u201d\n\n \u201cStraining all his nerves, he bowed:  As with the force of winds and waters pent,  When mountains tremble, those two massy pillars  With horrible convulsion to and fro  He tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew  The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder  Upon the heads of all who sat beneath,  Lords, ladies, captains, counsellors, or priests,  Their choice nobility and flower.\u201d  Milton\u2019s Samson Agonistes.",

            "dictText": "Heard of God. The peculiar circumstances connected with his birth are recorded in [1 Sam. 1:20](/1sam#1Sam.1.20). Hannah, one of the two wives of Elkanah, who came up to Shiloh to worship before the Lord, earnestly prayed to God that she might become the mother of a son. Her prayer was graciously granted; and after the child was weaned she brought him to Shiloh nd consecrated him to the Lord as a perpetual Nazarite (1:23-2:11). Here his bodily wants and training were attended to by the women who served in the tabernacle, while Eli cared for his religious culture. Thus, probably, twelve years of his life passed away. \u201cThe child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the Lord, and also with men\u201d (2:26; comp. [Luke 2:52](/luke#Luke.2.52)). It was a time of great and growing degeneracy in Israel ([Judg. 21:19-21](/judg#Judg.21.19); [1 Sam. 2:12-17](/1sam#1Sam.2.12), [22](/1sam#1Sam.2.22)). The Philistines, who of late had greatly increased in number and in power, were practically masters of the country, and kept the people in subjection ([1 Sam. 10:5](/1sam#1Sam.10.5); [13:3](/1sam#1Sam.13.3)).\n\n At this time new communications from God began to be made to the pious child. A mysterious voice came to him in the night season, calling him by name, and, instructed by Eli, he answered, \u201cSpeak, Lord; for thy servant heareth.\u201d The message that came from the Lord was one of woe and ruin to Eli and his profligate sons. Samuel told it all to Eli, whose only answer to the terrible denunciations ([1 Sam. 3:11-18](/1sam#1Sam.3.11)) was, \u201cIt is the Lord; let him do what seemeth him good\u201d, the passive submission of a weak character, not, in his case, the expression of the highest trust and faith. The Lord revealed himself now in divers manners to Samuel, and his fame and his influence increased throughout the land as of one divinely called to the prophetical office. A new period in the history of the kingdom of God now commenced.\n\n The Philistine yoke was heavy, and the people, groaning under the wide-spread oppression, suddenly rose in revolt, and \u201cwent out against the Philistines to battle.\u201d A fierce and disastrous battle was fought at Aphek, near to Ebenezer ([1 Sam. 4:1](/1sam#1Sam.4.1), [2](/1sam#1Sam.4.2)). The Israelites were defeated, leaving 4,000 dead \u201cin the field.\u201d The chiefs of the people thought to repair this great disaster by carrying with them the ark of the covenant as the symbol of Jehovah\u2019s presence. They accordingly, without consulting Samuel, fetched it out of Shiloh to the camp near Aphek. At the sight of the ark among them the people \u201cshouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.\u201d A second battle was fought, and again the Philistines defeated the Israelites, stormed their camp, slew 30,000 men, and took the sacred ark. The tidings of this fatal battle was speedily conveyed to Shiloh; and so soon as the aged Eli heard that the ark of God was taken, he fell backward from his seat at the entrance of the sanctuary, and his neck brake, and he died. The tabernacle with its furniture was probably, by the advice of Samuel, now about twenty years of age, removed from Shiloh to some place of safety, and finally to Nob, where it remained many years (21:1).\n\n The Philistines followed up their advantage, and marched upon Shiloh, which they plundered and destroyed (comp. [Jer. 7:12](/jer#Jer.7.12); [Ps. 78:59](/ps#Ps.78.59)). This was a great epoch in the history of Israel. For twenty years after this fatal battle at Aphek the whole land lay under the oppression of the Philistines. During all these dreary years Samuel was a spiritual power in the land. From Ramah, his native place, where he resided, his influence went forth on every side among the people. With unwearied zeal he went up and down from place to place, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people, endeavouring to awaken in them a sense of their sinfulness, and to lead them to repentance. His labours were so far successful that \u201call the house of Israel lamented after the Lord.\u201d Samuel summoned the people to Mizpeh, one of the loftiest hills in Central Palestine, where they fasted and prayed, and prepared themselves there, under his direction, for a great war against the Philistines, who now marched their whole force toward Mizpeh, in order to crush the Israelites once for all. At the intercession of Samuel God interposed in behalf of Israel. Samuel himself was their leader, the only occasion in which he acted as a leader in war. The Philistines were utterly routed. They fled in terror before the army of Israel, and a great slaughter ensued. This battle, fought probably about B.C. 1095, put an end to the forty years of Philistine oppression. In memory of this great deliverance, and in token of gratitude for the help vouchsafed, Samuel set up a great stone in the battlefield, and called it \u201cEbenezer,\u201d saying, \u201cHitherto hath the Lord helped us\u201d ([1 Sam. 7:1-12](/1sam#1Sam.7.1)). This was the spot where, twenty years before, the Israelites had suffered a great defeat, when the ark of God was taken.\n\n This victory over the Philistines was followed by a long period of peace for Israel ([1 Sam. 7:13](/1sam#1Sam.7.13), [14](/1sam#1Sam.7.14)), during which Samuel exercised the functions of judge, going \u201cfrom year to year in circuit\u201d from his home in Ramah to Bethel, thence to Gilgal (not that in the Jordan valley, but that which lay to the west of Ebal and Gerizim), and returning by Mizpeh to Ramah. He established regular services at Shiloh, where he built an altar; and at Ramah he gathered a company of young men around him and established a school of the prophets. The schools of the prophets, thus originated, and afterwards established also at Gibeah, Bethel, Gilgal, and Jericho, exercised an important influence on the national character and history of the people in maintaining pure religion in the midst of growing corruption. They continued to the end of the Jewish commonwealth.\n\n Many years now passed, during which Samuel exercised the functions of his judicial office, being the friend and counsellor of the people in all matters of private and public interest. He was a great statesman as well as a reformer, and all regarded him with veneration as the \u201cseer,\u201d the prophet of the Lord. At the close of this period, when he was now an old man, the elders of Israel came to him at Ramah ([1 Sam. 8:4](/1sam#1Sam.8.4), [5](/1sam#1Sam.8.5), [19-22](/1sam#1Sam.8.19)); and feeling how great was the danger to which the nation was exposed from the misconduct of Samuel\u2019s sons, whom he had invested with judicial functions as his assistants, and had placed at Beersheba on the Philistine border, and also from a threatened invasion of the Ammonites, they demanded that a king should be set over them. This request was very displeasing to Samuel. He remonstrated with them, and warned them of the consequences of such a step. At length, however, referring the matter to God, he acceded to their desires, and anointed Saul (q.v.) to be their king (11:15). Before retiring from public life he convened an assembly of the people at Gilgal (ch. 12), and there solemnly addressed them with reference to his own relation to them as judge and prophet.\n\n The remainder of his life he spent in retirement at Ramah, only occasionally and in special circumstances appearing again in public ([1 Sam. 13](/1sam#1Sam.13), [15](/1sam#1Sam.15)) with communications from God to king Saul. While mourning over the many evils which now fell upon the nation, he is suddenly summoned (ch. 16) to go to Bethlehem and anoint David, the son of Jesse, as king over Israel instead of Saul. After this little is known of him till the time of his death, which took place at Ramah when he was probably about eighty years of age. \u201cAnd all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah\u201d (25:1), not in the house itself, but in the court or garden of his house. (Comp. [2 Kings 21:18](/2kgs#2Kgs.21.18); [2 Chr. 33:20](/2chr#2Chr.33.20); [1 Kings 2:34](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.34); [John 19:41](/john#John.19.41).)\n\n Samuel\u2019s devotion to God, and the special favour with which God regarded him, are referred to in [Jer. 15:1](/jer#Jer.15.1) and [Ps. 99:6](/ps#Ps.99.6).",

            "dictText": "The son of Kish (probably his only son, and a child of prayer, \u201casked for\u201d), of the tribe of Benjamin, the first king of the Jewish nation. The singular providential circumstances connected with his election as king are recorded in [1 Sam. 8](/1sam#1Sam.8)-10. His father\u2019s she-asses had strayed, and Saul was sent with a servant to seek for them. Leaving his home at Gibeah (10:5, \u201cthe hill of God,\u201d A.V.; lit., as in R.V. marg., \u201cGibeah of God\u201d), Saul and his servant went toward the north-west over Mount Ephraim, and then turning north-east they came to \u201cthe land of Shalisha,\u201d and thence eastward to the land of Shalim, and at length came to the district of Zuph, near Samuel\u2019s home at Ramah (9:5-10). At this point Saul proposed to return from the three days\u2019 fruitless search, but his servant suggested that they should first consult the \u201cseer.\u201d Hearing that he was about to offer sacrifice, the two hastened into Ramah, and \u201cbehold, Samuel came out against them,\u201d on his way to the \u201cbamah\u201d, i.e., the \u201cheight\u201d, where sacrifice was to be offered; and in answer to Saul\u2019s question, \u201cTell me, I pray thee, where the seer\u2019s house is,\u201d Samuel made himself known to him. Samuel had been divinely prepared for his coming (9:15-17), and received Saul as his guest. He took him with him to the sacrifice, and then after the feast \u201ccommuned with Saul upon the top of the house\u201d of all that was in his heart. On the morrow Samuel \u201ctook a vial of oil and poured it on his head,\u201d and anointed Saul as king over Israel (9:25-10:8), giving him three signs in confirmation of his call to be king. When Saul reached his home in Gibeah the last of these signs was fulfilled, and the Sprit of God came upon him, and \u201che was turned into another man.\u201d The simple countryman was transformed into the king of Israel, a remarkable change suddenly took place in his whole demeanour, and the people said in their astonishment, as they looked on the stalwart son of Kish, \u201cIs Saul also among the prophets?\u201d, a saying which passed into a \u201cproverb.\u201d (Comp. 19:24.)\n\n The intercourse between Saul and Samuel was as yet unknown to the people. The \u201canointing\u201d had been in secret. But now the time had come when the transaction must be confirmed by the nation. Samuel accordingly summoned the people to a solemn assembly \u201cbefore the Lord\u201d at Mizpeh. Here the lot was drawn (10:17-27), and it fell upon Saul, and when he was presented before them, the stateliest man in all Israel, the air was rent for the first time in Israel by the loud cry, \u201cGod save the king!\u201d He now returned to his home in Gibeah, attended by a kind of bodyguard, \u201ca band of men whose hearts God had touched.\u201d On reaching his home he dismissed them, and resumed the quiet toils of his former life.\n\n Soon after this, on hearing of the conduct of Nahash the Ammonite at Jabeshgilead (q.v.), an army out of all the tribes of Israel rallied at his summons to the trysting-place at Bezek, and he led them forth a great army to battle, gaining a complete victory over the Ammonite invaders at Jabesh (11:1-11). Amid the universal joy occasioned by this victory he was now fully recognized as the king of Israel. At the invitation of Samuel \u201call the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the Lord in Gilgal.\u201d Samuel now officially anointed him as king (11:15). Although Samuel never ceased to be a judge in Israel, yet now his work in that capacity practically came to an end.\n\n Saul now undertook the great and difficult enterprise of freeing the land from its hereditary enemies the Philistines, and for this end he gathered together an army of 3,000 men ([1 Sam. 13:1](/1sam#1Sam.13.1), [2](/1sam#1Sam.13.2)). The Philistines were encamped at Geba. Saul, with 2,000 men, occupied Michmash and Mount Bethel; while his son Jonathan, with 1,000 men, occupied Gibeah, to the south of Geba, and seemingly without any direction from his father \u201csmote\u201d the Philistines in Geba. Thus roused, the Philistines, who gathered an army of 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and \u201cpeople as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude,\u201d encamped in Michmash, which Saul had evacuated for Gilgal. Saul now tarried for seven days in Gilgal before making any movement, as Samuel had appointed (10:8); but becoming impatient on the seventh day, as it was drawing to a close, when he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, Samuel appeared and warned him of the fatal consequences of his act of disobedience, for he had not waited long enough (13:13, 14).\n\n When Saul, after Samuel\u2019s departure, went out from Gilgal with his 600 men, his followers having decreased to that number (13:15), against the Philistines at Michmash (q.v.), he had his head-quarters under a pomegrante tree at Migron, over against Michmash, the Wady esSuweinit alone intervening. Here at Gibeah-Geba Saul and his army rested, uncertain what to do. Jonathan became impatient, and with his armour-bearer planned an assault against the Philistines, unknown to Saul and the army (14:1-15). Jonathan and his armour-bearer went down into the wady, and on their hands and knees climbed to the top of the narrow rocky ridge called Bozez, where was the outpost of the Philistine army. They surprised and then slew twenty of the Philistines, and immediately the whole host of the Philistines was thrown into disorder and fled in great terror. \u201cIt was a very great trembling;\u201d a supernatural panic seized the host. Saul and his 600 men, a band which speedily increased to 10,000, perceiving the confusion, pursued the army of the Philistines, and the tide of battle rolled on as far as to Bethaven, halfway between Michmash and Bethel. The Philistines were totally routed. \u201cSo the Lord saved Israel that day.\u201d While pursuing the Philistines, Saul rashly adjured the people, saying, \u201cCursed be the man that eateth any food until evening.\u201d But though faint and weary, the Israelites \u201csmote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon\u201d (a distance of from 15 to 20 miles). Jonathan had, while passing through the wood in pursuit of the Philistines, tasted a little of the honeycomb which was abundant there (14:27). This was afterwards discovered by Saul (ver. 42), and he threatened to put his son to death. The people, however, interposed, saying, \u201cThere shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground.\u201d He whom God had so signally owned, who had \u201cwrought this great salvation in Israel,\u201d must not die. \u201cThen Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their own place\u201d ([1 Sam. 14:24-46](/1sam#1Sam.14.24)); and thus the campaign against the Philistines came to an end. This was Saul\u2019s second great military success.\n\n Saul\u2019s reign, however, continued to be one of almost constant war against his enemies round about (14:47, 48), in all of which he proved victorious. The war against the Amalekites is the only one which is recorded at length ([1 Sam. 15](/1sam#1Sam.15)). These oldest and hereditary ([Ex. 17:8](/exod#Exod.17.8); [Num. 14:43-45](/num#Num.14.43)) enemies of Israel occupied the territory to the south and south-west of Palestine. Samuel summoned Saul to execute the \u201cban\u201d which God had pronounced ([Deut. 25:17-19](/deut#Deut.25.17)) on this cruel and relentless foe of Israel. The cup of their iniquity was now full. This command was \u201cthe test of his moral qualification for being king.\u201d Saul proceeded to execute the divine command; and gathering the people together, marched from Telaim ([1 Sam. 15:4](/1sam#1Sam.15.4)) against the Amalekites, whom he smote \u201cfrom Havilah until thou comest to Shur,\u201d utterly destroying \u201call the people with the edge of the sword\u201d, i.e., all that fell into his hands. He was, however, guilty of rebellion and disobedience in sparing Agag their king, and in conniving at his soldiers\u2019 sparing the best of the sheep and cattle; and Samuel, following Saul to Gilgal, in the Jordan valley, said unto him, \u201cBecause thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, he also hath rejected thee from being king\u201d (15:23). The kingdom was rent from Saul and was given to another, even to David, whom the Lord chose to be Saul\u2019s successor, and whom Samuel anointed (16:1-13). From that day \u201cthe spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.\u201d He and Samuel parted only to meet once again at one of the schools of the prophets.\n\n David was now sent for as a \u201ccunning player on an harp\u201d ([1 Sam. 16:16](/1sam#1Sam.16.16), [18](/1sam#1Sam.16.18)), to play before Saul when the evil spirit troubled him, and thus was introduced to the court of Saul. He became a great favourite with the king. At length David returned to his father\u2019s house and to his wonted avocation as a shepherd for perhaps some three years. The Philistines once more invaded the land, and gathered their army between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim, on the southern slope of the valley of Elah. Saul and the men of Israel went forth to meet them, and encamped on the northern slope of the same valley which lay between the two armies. It was here that David slew Goliath of Gath, the champion of the Philistines (17:4-54), an exploit which led to the flight and utter defeat of the Philistine army. Saul now took David permanently into his service (18:2); but he became jealous of him (ver. 9), and on many occasions showed his enmity toward him (ver. 10, 11), his enmity ripening into a purpose of murder which at different times he tried in vain to carry out.\n\n After some time the Philistines \u201cgathered themselves together\u201d in the plain of Esdraelon, and pitched their camp at Shunem, on the slope of Little Hermon; and Saul \u201cgathered all Israel together,\u201d and \u201cpitched in Gilboa\u201d ([1 Sam. 28:3-14](/1sam#1Sam.28.3)). Being unable to discover the mind of the Lord, Saul, accompanied by two of his retinue, betook himself to the \u201cwitch of Endor,\u201d some 7 or 8 miles distant. Here he was overwhelmed by the startling communication that was mysteriously made to him by Samuel (ver. 16-19), who appeared to him. \u201cHe fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel\u201d (ver. 20). The Philistine host \u201cfought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa\u201d (31:1). In his despair at the disaster that had befallen his army, Saul \u201ctook a sword and fell upon it.\u201d And the Philistines on the morrow \u201cfound Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.\u201d Having cut off his head, they sent it with his weapons to Philistia, and hung up the skull in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. They suspended his headless body, with that of Jonathan, from the walls of Bethshan. The men of Jabesh-gilead afterwards removed the bodies from this position; and having burnt the flesh, they buried the bodies under a tree at Jabesh. The remains were, however, afterwards removed to the family sepulchre at Zelah ([2 Sam. 21:13](/2sam#2Sam.21.13), [14](/2sam#2Sam.21.14)). (See DAVID.)",

            "dictText": "Sin (the god) sends many brothers, son of Sargon, whom he succeeded on the throne of Assyria (B.C. 705), in the 23rd year of Hezekiah. \u201cLike the Persian Xerxes, he was weak and vainglorious, cowardly under reverse, and cruel and boastful in success.\u201d He first set himself to break up the powerful combination of princes who were in league against him. Among these was Hezekiah, who had entered into an alliance with Egypt against Assyria. He accordingly led a very powerful army of at least 200,000 men into Judea, and devastated the land on every side, taking and destroying many cities ([2 Kings 18:13-16](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.13); comp. [Isa. 22](/isa#Isa.22), [24](/isa#Isa.24), [29](/isa#Isa.29), and [2 Chr. 32:1-8](/2chr#2Chr.32.1)). His own account of this invasion, as given in the Assyrian annals, is in these words: \u201cBecause Hezekiah, king of Judah, would not submit to my yoke, I came up against him, and by force of arms and by the might of my power I took forty-six of his strong fenced cities; and of the smaller towns which were scattered about, I took and plundered a countless number. From these places I took and carried off 200,156 persons, old and young, male and female, together with horses and mules, asses and camels, oxen and sheep, a countless multitude; and Hezekiah himself I shut up in Jerusalem, his capital city, like a bird in a cage, building towers round the city to hem him in, and raising banks of earth against the gates, so as to prevent escape...Then upon Hezekiah there fell the fear of the power of my arms, and he sent out to me the chiefs and the elders of Jerusalem with 30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and divers treasures, a rich and immense booty...All these things were brought to me at Nineveh, the seat of my government.\u201d (Comp. [Isa. 22:1-13](/isa#Isa.22.1) for description of the feelings of the inhabitants of Jerusalem at such a crisis.)\n\n Hezekiah was not disposed to become an Assyrian feudatory. He accordingly at once sought help from Egypt ([2 Kings 18:20-24](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.20)). Sennacherib, hearing of this, marched a second time into Palestine ([2 Kings 18:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.17), [37](/2kgs#2Kgs.18.37); 19; [2 Chr. 32:9-23](/2chr#2Chr.32.9); [Isa. 36:2-22](/isa#Isa.36.2). [Isa. 37:25](/isa#Isa.37.25) should be rendered \u201cdried up all the Nile-arms of Matsor,\u201d i.e., of Egypt, so called from the \u201cMatsor\u201d or great fortification across the isthmus of Suez, which protected it from invasions from the east). Sennacherib sent envoys to try to persuade Hezekiah to surrender, but in vain. (See TIRHAKAH.) He next sent a threatening letter ([2 Kings 19:10-14](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.10)), which Hezekiah carried into the temple and spread before the Lord. Isaiah again brought an encouraging message to the pious king ([2 Kings 19:20-34](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.20)). \u201cIn that night\u201d the angel of the Lord went forth and smote the camp of the Assyrians. In the morning, \u201cbehold, they were all dead corpses.\u201d The Assyrian army was annihilated.\n\n This great disaster is not, as was to be expected, taken notice of in the Assyrian annals.\n\n Though Sennacherib survived this disaster some twenty years, he never again renewed his attempt against Jerusalem. He was murdered by two of his own sons (Adrammelech and Sharezer), and was succeeded by another son, Esarhaddon (B.C. 681), after a reign of twenty-four years.",

When David was returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom, a strife arose between the ten tribes and the tribe of Judah, because the latter took the lead in bringing back the king. Sheba took advantage of this state of things, and raised the standard of revolt, proclaiming, \u201cWe have no part in David.\u201d With his followers he proceeded northward. David seeing it necessary to check this revolt, ordered Abishai to take the gibborim, \u201cmighty men,\u201d and the body-guard and such troops as he could gather, and pursue Sheba. Joab joined the expedition, and having treacherously put Amasa to death, assumed the command of the army. Sheba took refuge in Abel-Bethmaachah, a fortified town some miles north of Lake Merom. While Joab was engaged in laying siege to this city, Sheba\u2019s head was, at the instigation of a \u201cwise woman\u201d who had held a parley with him from the city walls, thrown over the wall to the besiegers, and thus the revolt came to an end.",

She stretched forth her hand to the nail,  Her right hand to the workman\u2019s hammer,  And she smote Sisera; she crushed his head,  She crashed through and transfixed his temples.  At her feet he curled himself, he fell, he lay still;  At her feet he curled himself, he fell;  And where he curled himself, there he fell dead.\u201d",

            "dictText": "Peaceful, (Heb. Shelomoh), David\u2019s second son by Bathsheba, i.e., the first after their legal marriage ([2 Sam. 12](/2sam#2Sam.12)). He was probably born about B.C. 1035 ([1 Chr. 22:5](/1chr#1Chr.22.5); [29:1](/1chr#1Chr.29.1)). He succeeded his father on the throne in early manhood, probably about sixteen or eighteen years of age. Nathan, to whom his education was intrusted, called him Jedidiah, i.e., \u201cbeloved of the Lord\u201d ([2 Sam. 12:24](/2sam#2Sam.12.24), [25](/2sam#2Sam.12.25)). He was the first king of Israel \u201cborn in the purple.\u201d His father chose him as his successor, passing over the claims of his elder sons: \u201cAssuredly Solomon my son shall reign after me.\u201d His history is recorded in [1 Kings 1](/1kgs#1Kgs.1)-11 and [2 Chr. 1](/2chr#2Chr.1)-9. His elevation to the throne took place before his father\u2019s death, and was hastened on mainly by Nathan and Bathsheba, in consequence of the rebellion of Adonijah ([1 Kings 1:5-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.1.5)). During his long reign of forty years the Hebrew monarchy gained its highest splendour. This period has well been called the \u201cAugustan age\u201d of the Jewish annals. The first half of his reign was, however, by far the brighter and more prosperous; the latter half was clouded by the idolatries into which he fell, mainly from his heathen intermarriages ([1 Kings 11:1-8](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1); [14:21](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.21), [31](/1kgs#1Kgs.14.31)).\n\n Before his death David gave parting instructions to his son ([1 Kings 2:1-9](/1kgs#1Kgs.2.1); [1 Chr. 22:7-16](/1chr#1Chr.22.7); [28](/1chr#1Chr.28)). As soon as he had settled himself in his kingdom, and arranged the affairs of his extensive empire, he entered into an alliance with Egypt by the marriage of the daughter of Pharaoh ([1 Kings 3:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.3.1)), of whom, however, nothing further is recorded. He surrounded himself with all the luxuries and the external grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings. (See HIRAM.)\n\n For some years before his death David was engaged in the active work of collecting materials ([1 Chr. 29:6-9](/1chr#1Chr.29.6); [2 Chr. 2:3-7](/2chr#2Chr.2.3)) for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent abode for the ark of the covenant. He was not permitted to build the house of God ([1 Chr. 22:8](/1chr#1Chr.22.8)); that honour was reserved to his son Solomon. (See TEMPLE.)\n\n After the completion of the temple, Solomon engaged in the erection of many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem and in other parts of his kingdom. For the long space of thirteen years he was engaged in the erection of a royal palace on Ophel ([1 Kings 7:1-12](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.1)). It was 100 cubits long, 50 broad, and 30 high. Its lofty roof was supported by forty-five cedar pillars, so that the hall was like a forest of cedar wood, and hence probably it received the name of \u201cThe House of the Forest of Lebanon.\u201d In front of this \u201chouse\u201d was another building, which was called the Porch of Pillars, and in front of this again was the \u201cHall of Judgment,\u201d or Throne-room ([1 Kings 7:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.7.7); [10:18-20](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.18); [2 Chr. 9:17-19](/2chr#2Chr.9.17)), \u201cthe King\u2019s Gate,\u201d where he administered justice and gave audience to his people. This palace was a building of great magnificence and beauty. A portion of it was set apart as the residence of the queen consort, the daughter of Pharaoh. From the palace there was a private staircase of red and scented sandal wood which led up to the temple.\n\n Solomon also constructed great works for the purpose of securing a plentiful supply of water for the city ([Eccl. 2:4-6](/eccl#Eccl.2.4)). He then built Millo (LXX., \u201cAcra\u201d) for the defence of the city, completing a line of ramparts around it ([1 Kings 9:15](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15), [24](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.24); 11:27). He erected also many other fortifications for the defence of his kingdom at various points where it was exposed to the assault of enemies ([1 Kings 9:15-19](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.15); [2 Chr. 8:2-6](/2chr#2Chr.8.2)). Among his great undertakings must also be mentioned the building of Tadmor (q.v.) in the wilderness as a commercial depot, as well as a military outpost.\n\n During his reign Palestine enjoyed great commercial prosperity. Extensive traffic was carried on by land with Tyre and Egypt and Arabia, and by sea with Spain and India and the coasts of Africa, by which Solomon accumulated vast stores of wealth and of the produce of all nations ([1 Kings 9:26-28](/1kgs#1Kgs.9.26); [10:11](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.11), [12](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.12); [2 Chr. 8:17](/2chr#2Chr.8.17), [18](/2chr#2Chr.8.18); 9:21). This was the \u201cgolden age\u201d of Israel. The royal magnificence and splendour of Solomon\u2019s court were unrivalled. He had seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, an evidence at once of his pride, his wealth, and his sensuality. The maintenance of his household involved immense expenditure. The provision required for one day was \u201cthirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallow-deer, and fatted fowl\u201d ([1 Kings 4:22](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.22), [23](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.23)).\n\n Solomon\u2019s reign was not only a period of great material prosperity, but was equally remarkable for its intellectual activity. He was the leader of his people also in this uprising amongst them of new intellectual life. \u201cHe spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes\u201d ([1 Kings 4:32](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.32), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.4.33)).\n\n His fame was spread abroad through all lands, and men came from far and near \u201cto hear the wisdom of Solomon.\u201d Among others thus attracted to Jerusalem was \u201cthe queen of the south\u201d ([Matt. 12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42)), the queen of Sheba, a country in Arabia Felix. \u201cDeep, indeed, must have been her yearning, and great his fame, which induced a secluded Arabian queen to break through the immemorial custom of her dreamy land, and to put forth the energy required for braving the burdens and perils of so long a journey across a wilderness. Yet this she undertook, and carried it out with safety.\u201d ([1 Kings 10:1-13](/1kgs#1Kgs.10.1); [2 Chr. 9:1-12](/2chr#2Chr.9.1).) She was filled with amazement by all she saw and heard: \u201cthere was no more spirit in her.\u201d After an interchange of presents she returned to her native land.\n\n But that golden age of Jewish history passed away. The bright day of Solomon\u2019s glory ended in clouds and darkness. His decline and fall from his high estate is a sad record. Chief among the causes of his decline were his polygamy and his great wealth. \u201cAs he grew older he spent more of his time among his favourites. The idle king living among these idle women, for 1,000 women, with all their idle and mischievous attendants, filled the palaces and pleasure-houses which he had built ([1 Kings 11:3](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.3)), learned first to tolerate and then to imitate their heathenish ways. He did not, indeed, cease to believe in the God of Israel with his mind. He did not cease to offer the usual sacrifices in the temple at the great feasts. But his heart was not right with God; his worship became merely formal; his soul, left empty by the dying out of true religious fervour, sought to be filled with any religious excitement which offered itself. Now for the first time a worship was publicly set up amongst the people of the Lord which was not simply irregular or forbidden, like that of Gideon ([Judg. 8:27](/judg#Judg.8.27)), or the Danites ([Judg. 18:30](/judg#Judg.18.30), [31](/judg#Judg.18.31)), but was downright idolatrous.\u201d ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13).)\n\n This brought upon him the divine displeasure. His enemies prevailed against him ([1 Kings 11:14-22](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.14), [23-25](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.23), [26-40](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.26)), and one judgment after another fell upon the land. And now the end of all came, and he died, after a reign of forty years, and was buried in the city of David, and \u201cwith him was buried the short-lived glory and unity of Israel.\u201d \u201cHe leaves behind him but one weak and worthless son, to dismember his kingdom and disgrace his name.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe kingdom of Solomon,\u201d says Rawlinson, \u201cis one of the most striking facts in the Biblical history. A petty nation, which for hundreds of years has with difficulty maintained a separate existence in the midst of warlike tribes, each of which has in turn exercised dominion over it and oppressed it, is suddenly raised by the genius of a soldier-monarch to glory and greatness. An empire is established which extends from the Euphrates to the borders of Egypt, a distance of 450 miles; and this empire, rapidly constructed, enters almost immediately on a period of peace which lasts for half a century. Wealth, grandeur, architectural magnificence, artistic excellence, commercial enterprise, a position of dignity among the great nations of the earth, are enjoyed during this space, at the end of which there is a sudden collapse. The ruling nation is split in twain, the subject-races fall off, the pre-eminence lately gained being wholly lost, the scene of struggle, strife, oppression, recovery, inglorious submission, and desperate effort, re-commences.\u201d, Historical Illustrations.",

We know nothing of his father but that he was a Greek ([Acts 16:1](/acts#Acts.16.1)). He is first brought into notice at the time of Paul\u2019s second visit to Lystra (16:2), where he probably resided, and where it seems he was converted during Paul\u2019s first visit to that place ([1 Tim. 1:2](/1tim#1Tim.1.2); [2 Tim. 3:11](/2tim#2Tim.3.11)). The apostle having formed a high opinion of his \u201cown son in the faith,\u201d arranged that he should become his companion ([Acts 16:3](/acts#Acts.16.3)), and took and circumcised him, so that he might conciliate the Jews. He was designated to the office of an evangelist ([1 Tim. 4:14](/1tim#1Tim.4.14)), and went with Paul in his journey through Phrygia, Galatia, and Mysia; also to Troas and Philippi and Berea ([Acts 17:14](/acts#Acts.17.14)). Thence he followed Paul to Athens, and was sent by him with Silas on a mission to Thessalonica (17:15; [1 Thess. 3:2](/1thess#1Thess.3.2)). We next find him at Corinth ([1 Thess. 1:1](/1thess#1Thess.1.1); [2 Thess. 1:1](/2thess#2Thess.1.1)) with Paul. He passes now out of sight for a few years, and is again noticed as with the apostle at Ephesus ([Acts 19:22](/acts#Acts.19.22)), whence he is sent on a mission into Macedonia. He accompanied Paul afterwards into Asia (20:4), where he was with him for some time. When the apostle was a prisoner at Rome, Timothy joined him ([Phil. 1:1](/phil#Phil.1.1)), where it appears he also suffered imprisonment ([Heb. 13:23](/heb#Heb.13.23)). During the apostle\u2019s second imprisonment he wrote to Timothy, asking him to rejoin him as soon as possible, and to bring with him certain things which he had left at Troas, his cloak and parchments ([2 Tim. 4:13](/2tim#2Tim.4.13)). According to tradition, after the apostle\u2019s death he settled in Ephesus as his sphere of labour, and there found a martyr\u2019s grave.",

He appears to have been a Gentile, and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles; for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, inasmuch as in his case the cause of gospel liberty was at stake. We find him, at a later period, with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there in behalf of the poor saints at Jerusalem sent forward ([2 Cor. 8:6](/2cor#2Cor.8.6); [12:18](/2cor#2Cor.12.18)). He rejoined the apostle when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth (7:6-15). After this his name is not mentioned till after Paul\u2019s first imprisonment, when we find him engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where the apostle had left him for this purpose ([Titus 1:5](/titus#Titus.1.5)). The last notice of him is in [2 Tim. 4:10](/2tim#2Tim.4.10), where we find him with Paul at Rome during his second imprisonment.

His long reign of about fifty-two years was \u201cthe most prosperous excepting that of Jehosaphat since the time of Solomon.\u201d He was a vigorous and able ruler, and \u201chis name spread abroad, even to the entering in of Egypt\u201d ([2 Chr. 26:8](/2chr#2Chr.26.8), [14](/2chr#2Chr.26.14)). In the earlier part of his reign, under the influence of Zechariah, he was faithful to Jehovah, and \u201cdid that which was right in the sight of the Lord\u201d ([2 Kings 15:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.3); [2 Chr. 26:4](/2chr#2Chr.26.4), [5](/2chr#2Chr.26.5)); but toward the close of his long life \u201chis heart was lifted up to his destruction,\u201d and he wantonly invaded the priest\u2019s office ([2 Chr. 26:16](/2chr#2Chr.26.16)), and entering the sanctuary proceeded to offer incense on the golden altar. Azariah the high priest saw the tendency of such a daring act on the part of the king, and with a band of eighty priests he withstood him ([2 Chr. 26:17](/2chr#2Chr.26.17)), saying, \u201cIt appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense.\u201d Uzziah was suddenly struck with leprosy while in the act of offering incense (26:19-21), and he was driven from the temple and compelled to reside in \u201ca several house\u201d to the day of his death ([2 Kings 15:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.5), [27](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.27); [2 Chr. 26:3](/2chr#2Chr.26.3)). He was buried in a separate grave \u201cin the field of the burial which belonged to the kings\u201d ([2 Kings 15:7](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.7); [2 Chr. 26:23](/2chr#2Chr.26.23)). \u201cThat lonely grave in the royal necropolis would eloquently testify to coming generations that all earthly monarchy must bow before the inviolable order of the divine will, and that no interference could be tolerated with that unfolding of the purposes of God, which, in the fulness of time, would reveal the Christ, the true High Priest and King for evermore\u201d (Dr. Green\u2019s Kingdom of Israel, etc.).",

When our Lord reached the spot he looked up to the publican among the branches, and addressing him by name, told him to make haste and come down, as he intended that day to abide at his house. This led to the remarkable interview recorded by the evangelist, and to the striking parable of the ten pounds ([Luke 19:12-27](/luke#Luke.19.12)).

Only four of these courses or \u201cfamilies\u201d of the priests returned from the Exile ([Ezra 2:36-39](/ezra#Ezra.2.36)); but they were then re-distributed under the old designations. The priests served at the temple twice each year, and only for a week each time. Zacharias\u2019s time had come for this service. During this period his home would be one of the chambers set apart for the priests on the sides of the temple ground. The offering of incense was one of the most solemn parts of the daily worship of the temple, and lots were drawn each day to determine who should have this great honour, an honour which no priest could enjoy more than once during his lifetime.\n\n While Zacharias ministered at the golden altar of incense in the holy place, it was announced to him by the angel Gabriel that his wife Elisabeth, who was also of a priestly family, now stricken in years, would give birth to a son who was to be called John, and that he would be the forerunner of the long-expected Messiah ([Luke 1:12-17](/luke#Luke.1.12)). As a punishment for his refusing to believe this message, he was struck dumb and \u201cnot able to speak until the day that these things should be performed\u201d (20). Nine months passed away, and Elisabeth\u2019s child was born, and when in answer to their inquiry Zacharias wrote on a \u201cwriting tablet,\u201d \u201cHis name is John,\u201d his mouth was opened, and he praised God (60-79).

He describes himself (1:1) as \u201cthe son of Berechiah.\u201d In [Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1) and 6:14 he is called \u201cthe son of Iddo,\u201d who was properly his grandfather. His prophetical career began in the second year of Darius (B.C. 520), about sixteen years after the return of the first company from exile. He was contemporary with Haggai ([Ezra 5:1](/ezra#Ezra.5.1)).\n\n His book consists of two distinct parts, (1) chapters 1 to 8, inclusive, and (2) 9 to the end. It begins with a preface (1:1-6), which recalls the nation\u2019s past history, for the purpose of presenting a solemn warning to the present generation. Then follows a series of eight visions (1:7-6:8), succeeding one another in one night, which may be regarded as a symbolical history of Israel, intended to furnish consolation to the returned exiles and stir up hope in their minds. The symbolical action, the crowning of Joshua (6:9-15), describes how the kingdoms of the world become the kingdom of God\u2019s Christ.\n\n Chapters 7 and 8, delivered two years later, are an answer to the question whether the days of mourning for the destruction of the city should be any longer kept, and an encouraging address to the people, assuring them of God\u2019s presence and blessing.\n\n The second part of the book (ch. 9-14) bears no date. It is probable that a considerable interval separates it from the first part. It consists of two burdens.\n\n The first burden (ch. 9-11) gives an outline of the course of God\u2019s providential dealings with his people down to the time of the Advent.\n\n The second burden (ch. 12-14) points out the glories that await Israel in \u201cthe latter day\u201d, the final conflict and triumph of God\u2019s kingdom.",

He was the third son of Josiah, and his mother\u2019s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah, and hence he was the brother of Jehoahaz ([2 Kings 23:31](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.31); [24:17](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.17), [18](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.18)). His original name was Mattaniah; but when Nebuchadnezzar placed him on the throne as the successor to Jehoiachin he changed his name to Zedekiah. The prophet Jeremiah was his counsellor, yet \u201che did evil in the sight of the Lord\u201d ([2 Kings 24:19](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.19), [20](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.20); [Jer. 52:2](/jer#Jer.52.2), [3](/jer#Jer.52.3)). He ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years. The kingdom was at that time tributary to Nebuchadnezzar; but, despite the strong remonstrances of Jeremiah and others, as well as the example of Jehoiachin, he threw off the yoke of Babylon, and entered into an alliance with Hophra, king of Egypt. This brought up Nebuchadnezzar, \u201cwith all his host\u201d ([2 King 25:1](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1)), against Jerusalem. During this siege, which lasted about eighteen months, \u201cevery worst woe befell the devoted city, which drank the cup of God\u2019s fury to the dregs\u201d ([2 Kings 25:3](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.3); [Lam. 4:4](/lam#Lam.4.4), [5](/lam#Lam.4.5), [10](/lam#Lam.4.10)). The city was plundered and laid in ruins. Zedekiah and his followers, attempting to escape, were made captive and taken to Riblah. There, after seeing his own children put to death, his own eyes were put out, and, being loaded with chains, he was carried captive (B.C. 588) to Babylon ([2 Kings 25:1-7](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.1); [2 Chr. 36:12](/2chr#2Chr.36.12); [Jer. 32:4](/jer#Jer.32.4), [5](/jer#Jer.32.5); 34:2, 3; 39:1-7; 52:4-11; [Ezek. 12:12](/ezek#Ezek.12.12)), where he remained a prisoner, how long is unknown, to the day of his death.\n\n After the fall of Jerusalem, Nebuzaraddan was sent to carry out its complete destruction. The city was razed to the ground. Only a small number of vinedressers and husbandmen were permitted to remain in the land ([Jer. 52:16](/jer#Jer.52.16)). Gedaliah, with a Chaldean guard stationed at Mizpah, ruled over Judah ([2 Kings 25:22](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.22), [24](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.24); jer. 40:1, 2, 5, 6).",

            "dictText": "A fishery, a town on the Mediterranean coast, about 25 miles north of Tyre. It received its name from the \u201cfirst-born\u201d of Canaan, the grandson of Noah ([Gen. 10:15](/gen#Gen.10.15), [19](/gen#Gen.10.19)). It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Palestine, and from its extensive commercial relations became a \u201cgreat\u201d city ([Josh. 11:8](/josh#Josh.11.8); [19:28](/josh#Josh.19.28)). It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued ([Judg. 1:31](/judg#Judg.1.31)). The Zidonians long oppressed Israel ([Judg. 10:12](/judg#Judg.10.12)). From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its \u201cvirgin daughter\u201d ([Isa. 23:12](/isa#Isa.23.12)), rose to its place of pre-eminence. Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Zidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel ([1 Kings 11:1](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.1), [33](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.33)). This city was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce ([1 Kings 5:6](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.6); [1 Chr. 22:4](/1chr#1Chr.22.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8)). It is frequently referred to by the prophets ([Isa. 23:2](/isa#Isa.23.2), [4](/isa#Isa.23.4), [12](/isa#Isa.23.12); [Jer. 25:22](/jer#Jer.25.22); [27:3](/jer#Jer.27.3); [47:4](/jer#Jer.47.4); [Ezek. 27:8](/ezek#Ezek.27.8); [28:21](/ezek#Ezek.28.21), [22](/ezek#Ezek.28.22); [32:30](/ezek#Ezek.32.30); [Joel 3:4](/joel#Joel.3.4)). Our Lord visited the \u201ccoasts\u201d of Tyre and Zidon = Sidon (q.v.), [Matt. 15:21](/matt#Matt.15.21); [Mark 7:24](/mark#Mark.7.24); [Luke 4:26](/luke#Luke.4.26); and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching ([Mark 3:8](/mark#Mark.3.8); [Luke 6:17](/luke#Luke.6.17)). From Sidon, at which the ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome ([Acts 27:3](/acts#Acts.27.3), [4](/acts#Acts.27.4)).\n\n This city is now a town of 10,000 inhabitants, with remains of walls built in the twelfth century A.D. In 1855, the sarcophagus of Eshmanezer was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a \u201cking of the Sidonians,\u201d probably in the third century B.C., and that his mother was a priestess of Ashtoreth, \u201cthe goddess of the Sidonians.\u201d In this inscription Baal is mentioned as the chief god of the Sidonians.",
