It was famed for its fertility and its riches. Its capital was the city of Babylon, a great commercial centre ([Ezek. 17:4](/ezek#Ezek.17.4); [Isa. 43:14](/isa#Isa.43.14)). Babylonia was divided into the two districts of Accad in the north, and Summer (probably the Shinar of the Old Testament) in the south. Among its chief cities may be mentioned Ur (now Mugheir or Mugayyar), on the western bank of the Euphrates; Uruk, or Erech ([Gen. 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)) (now Warka), between Ur and Babylon; Larsa (now Senkereh), the Ellasar of [Gen. 14:1](/gen#Gen.14.1), a little to the east of Erech; Nipur (now Niffer), south-east of Babylon; Sepharvaim ([2 Kings 17:24](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)), \u201cthe two Sipparas\u201d (now Abu-Habba), considerably to the north of Babylon; and Eridu, \u201cthe good city\u201d (now Abu-Shahrein), which lay originally on the shore of the Persian Gulf, but is now, owing to the silting up of the sand, about 100 miles distant from it. Another city was Kulunu, or Calneh ([Gen. 10:10](/gen#Gen.10.10)).\n\n The salt-marshes at the mouths of the Euphrates and Tigris were called Marratu, \u201cthe bitter\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d, the Merathaim of [Jer. 50:21](/jer#Jer.50.21). They were the original home of the Kalda, or Chaldeans.\n\n The most famous of the early kings of Babylonia were Sargon of Accad (B.C. 3800) and his son, Naram-Sin, who conquered a large part of Western Asia, establishing their power in Palestine, and even carrying their arms to the Sinaitic peninsula. A great Babylonian library was founded in the reign of Sargon. Babylonia was subsequently again broken up into more than one state, and at one time fell under the domination of Elam. This was put an end to by Khammu-rabi (Amraphel), who drove the Elamites out of the country, and overcame Arioch, the son of an Elamite prince. From this time forward Babylonia was a united monarchy. About B.C. 1750 it was conquered by the Kassi, or Kosseans, from the mountains of Elam, and a Kassite dynasty ruled over it for 576 years and 9 months.\n\n In the time of Khammu-rabi, Syria and Palestine were subject to Babylonia and its Elamite suzerain; and after the overthrow of the Elamite supremacy, the Babylonian kings continued to exercise their influence and power in what was called \u201cthe land of the Amorites.\u201d In the epoch of the Kassite dynasty, however, Canaan passed into the hands of Egypt.\n\n In B.C. 729, Babylonia was conquered by the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III.; but on the death of Shalmaneser IV. it was seized by the Kalda or \u201cChaldean\u201d prince Merodach-baladan ([2 Kings 20:12-19](/2kgs#2Kgs.20.12)), who held it till B.C. 709, when he was driven out by Sargon.\n\n Under Sennacherib, Babylonia revolted from Assyria several times, with the help of the Elamites, and after one of these revolts Babylon was destroyed by Sennacherib, B.C. 689. It was rebuilt by Esarhaddon, who made it his residence during part of the year, and it was to Babylon that Manasseh was brought a prisoner ([2 Chr. 33:11](/2chr#2Chr.33.11)). After the death of Esarhaddon, Saul-sumyukin, the viceroy of Babylonia, revolted against his brother the Assyrian king, and the revolt was suppressed with difficulty.\n\n When Nineveh was destroyed, B.C. 606, Nabopolassar, the viceroy of Babylonia, who seems to have been of Chaldean descent, made himself independent. His son Nebuchadrezzar (Nabu-kudur-uzur), after defeating the Egyptians at Carchemish, succeeded him as king, B.C. 604, and founded the Babylonian empire. He strongly fortified Babylon, and adorned it with palaces and other buildings. His son, Evil-merodach, who succeeded him in B.C. 561, was murdered after a reign of two years. The last monarch of the Babylonian empire was Nabonidus (Nabu-nahid), B.C. 555-538, whose eldest son, Belshazzar (Bilu-sar-uzur), is mentioned in several inscriptions. Babylon was captured by Cyrus, B.C. 538, and though it revolted more than once in later years, it never succeeded in maintaining its independence.",

This was necessarily done by the translators of the Scriptures, for no literal translation could properly express all that is implied in them.\n\n The mode of baptism can in no way be determined from the Greek word rendered \u201cbaptize.\u201d Baptists say that it means \u201cto dip,\u201d and nothing else. That is an incorrect view of the meaning of the word. It means both (1) to dip a thing into an element or liquid, and (2) to put an element or liquid over or on it. Nothing therefore as to the mode of baptism can be concluded from the mere word used. The word has a wide latitude of meaning, not only in the New Testament, but also in the LXX. Version of the Old Testament, where it is used of the ablutions and baptisms required by the Mosaic law. These were effected by immersion, and by affusion and sprinkling; and the same word, \u201cwashings\u201d ([Heb. 9:10](/heb#Heb.9.10), [13](/heb#Heb.9.13), [19](/heb#Heb.9.19), [21](/heb#Heb.9.21)) or \u201cbaptisms,\u201d designates them all. In the New Testament there cannot be found a single well-authenticated instance of the occurrence of the word where it necessarily means immersion. Moreover, none of the instances of baptism recorded in the Acts of the Apostles (2:38-41; 8:26-39; 9:17, 18; 22:12-16; 10:44-48; 16:32-34) favours the idea that it was by dipping the person baptized, or by immersion, while in some of them such a mode was highly improbable.\n\n The gospel and its ordinances are designed for the whole world, and it cannot be supposed that a form for the administration of baptism would have been prescribed which would in any place (as in a tropical country or in polar regions) or under any circumstances be inapplicable or injurious or impossible.\n\n Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper are the two symbolical ordinances of the New Testament. The Supper represents the work of Christ, and Baptism the work of the Spirit. As in the Supper a small amount of bread and wine used in this ordinance exhibits in symbol the great work of Christ, so in Baptism the work of the Holy Spirit is fully seen in the water poured or sprinkled on the person in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. That which is essential in baptism is only \u201cwashing with water,\u201d no mode being specified and none being necessary or essential to the symbolism of the ordinance.\n\n The apostles of our Lord were baptized with the Holy Ghost ([Matt. 3:11](/matt#Matt.3.11)) by his coming upon them ([Acts 1:8](/acts#Acts.1.8)). The fire also with which they were baptized sat upon them. The extraordinary event of Pentecost was explained by Peter as a fulfilment of the ancient promise that the Spirit would be poured out in the last days (2:17). He uses also with the same reference the expression shed forth as descriptive of the baptism of the Spirit (33). In the Pentecostal baptism \u201cthe apostles were not dipped into the Spirit, nor plunged into the Spirit; but the Spirit was shed forth, poured out, fell on them (11:15), came upon them, sat on them.\u201d That was a real and true baptism. We are warranted from such language to conclude that in like manner when water is poured out, falls, comes upon or rests upon a person when this ordinance is administered, that person is baptized. Baptism is therefore, in view of all these arguments \u201crightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.\u201d\n\n The subjects of baptism. This raises questions of greater importance than those relating to its mode.\n\n 1. The controversy here is not about \u201cbelievers\u2019 baptism,\u201d for that is common to all parties. Believers were baptized in apostolic times, and they have been baptized in all time by all the branches of the church. It is altogether a misrepresentation to allege, as is sometimes done by Baptists, that their doctrine is \u201cbelievers\u2019 baptism.\u201d Every instance of adult baptism, or of \u201cbelievers\u2019 baptism,\u201d recorded in the New Testament ([Acts 2:41](/acts#Acts.2.41); [8:37](/acts#Acts.8.37); [9:17](/acts#Acts.9.17), [18](/acts#Acts.9.18); [10:47](/acts#Acts.10.47); [16:15](/acts#Acts.16.15); [19:5](/acts#Acts.19.5), etc.) is just such as would be dealt with in precisely the same way by all branches of the Protestant Church, a profession of faith or of their being \u201cbelievers\u201d would be required from every one of them before baptism. The point in dispute is not the baptism of believers, but whether the infant children of believers, i.e., of members of the church, ought to be baptized.\n\n 2. In support of the doctrine of infant baptism, i.e., of the baptism of the infants, or rather the \u201cchildren,\u201d of believing parents, the following considerations may be adduced:\n\n The Church of Christ exists as a divinely organized community. It is the \u201ckingdom of God,\u201d one historic kingdom under all dispensations. The commonwealth of Israel was the \u201cchurch\u201d ([Acts 7:38](/acts#Acts.7.38); [Rom. 9:4](/rom#Rom.9.4)) under the Mosaic dispensation. The New Testament church is not a new and different church, but one with that of the Old Testament. The terms of admission into the church have always been the same viz., a profession of faith and a promise of subjection to the laws of the kingdom. Now it is a fact beyond dispute that the children of God\u2019s people under the old dispensation were recognized as members of the church. Circumcision was the sign and seal of their membership. It was not because of carnal descent from Abraham, but as being the children of God\u2019s professing people, that this rite was administered ([Rom. 4:11](/rom#Rom.4.11)). If children were members of the church under the old dispensation, which they undoubtedly were, then they are members of the church now by the same right, unless it can be shown that they have been expressly excluded. Under the Old Testament parents acted for their children and represented them. (See [Gen. 9:9](/gen#Gen.9.9); [17:10](/gen#Gen.17.10); [Ex. 24:7](/exod#Exod.24.7), [8](/exod#Exod.24.8); [Deut. 29:9-13](/deut#Deut.29.9).) When parents entered into covenant with God, they brought their children with them. This was a law in the Hebrew Church. When a proselyte was received into membership, he could not enter without bringing his children with him. The New Testament does not exclude the children of believers from the church. It does not deprive them of any privilege they enjoyed under the Old Testament. There is no command or statement of any kind, that can be interpreted as giving any countenance to such an idea, anywhere to be found in the New Testament. The church membership of infants has never been set aside. The ancient practice, orginally appointed by God himself, must remain a law of his kingdom till repealed by the same divine authority. There are lambs in the fold of the Good Shepherd ([John 21:15](/john#John.21.15); comp. [Luke 1:15](/luke#Luke.1.15); [Matt. 19:14](/matt#Matt.19.14); [1 Cor. 7:14](/1cor#1Cor.7.14)).\n\n \u201cIn a company of converts applying for admission into Christ\u2019s house there are likely to be some heads of families. How is their case to be treated? How, for example, are Lydia and her neighbour the keeper of the city prison to be treated? Both have been converted. Both are heads of families. They desire to be received into the infant church of Philippi. What is Christ\u2019s direction to them? Shall we say that it is to this effect: \u2019Arise, and wash away your sins, and come into my house. But you must come in by yourselves. These babes in your arms, you must leave them outside. They cannot believe yet, and so they cannot come in. Those other little ones by your side, their hearts may perhaps have been touched with the love of God; still, they are not old enough to make a personal profession, so they too must be left outside...For the present you must leave them where they are and come in by yourselves.\u2019 One may reasonably demand very stringent proofs before accepting this as a fair representation of the sort of welcome Christ offers to parents who come to his door bringing their children with them. Surely it is more consonant with all we know about him to suppose that his welcome will be more ample in its scope, and will breathe a more gracious tone. Surely it would be more like the Good Shepherd to say, \u2018Come in, and bring your little ones along with you. The youngest needs my salvation; and the youngest is accessible to my salvation. You may be unable as yet to deal with them about either sin or salvation, but my gracious power can find its way into their hearts even now. I can impart to them pardon and a new life. From Adam they have inherited sin and death; and I can so unite them to myself that in me they shall be heirs of righteousness and life. You may without misgiving bring them to me. And the law of my house requires that the same day which witnesses your reception into it by baptism must witness their reception also\u2019\u201d (The Church, by Professor Binnie, D.D.).",

            "dictText": "The remaining chapters of the second book contain the history of the separate kingdom of Judah to the time of the return from Babylonian Exile.\n\n The time of the composition of the Chronicles was, there is every ground to conclude, subsequent to the Babylonian Exile, probably between 450 and 435 B.C. The contents of this twofold book, both as to matter and form, correspond closely with this idea. The close of the book records the proclamation of Cyrus permitting the Jews to return to their own land, and this forms the opening passage of the Book of Ezra, which must be viewed as a continuation of the Chronicles. The peculiar form of the language, being Aramaean in its general character, harmonizes also with that of the books which were written after the Exile. The author was certainly contemporary with Zerubbabel, details of whose family history are given ([1 Chr. 3:19](/1chr#1Chr.3.19)).\n\n The time of the composition being determined, the question of the authorship may be more easily decided. According to Jewish tradition, which was universally received down to the middle of the seventeenth century, Ezra was regarded as the author of the Chronicles. There are many points of resemblance and of contact between the Chronicles and the Book of Ezra which seem to confirm this opinion. The conclusion of the one and the beginning of the other are almost identical in expression. In their spirit and characteristics they are the same, showing thus also an identity of authorship.\n\n In their general scope and design these books are not so much historical as didactic. The principal aim of the writer appears to be to present moral and religious truth. He does not give prominence to political occurences, as is done in Samuel and Kings, but to ecclesiastical institutions. \u201cThe genealogies, so uninteresting to most modern readers, were really an important part of the public records of the Hebrew state. They were the basis on which not only the land was distributed and held, but the public services of the temple were arranged and conducted, the Levites and their descendants alone, as is well known, being entitled and first fruits set apart for that purpose.\u201d The \u201cChronicles\u201d are an epitome of the sacred history from the days of Adam down to the return from Babylonian Exile, a period of about 3,500 years. The writer gathers up \u201cthe threads of the old national life broken by the Captivity.\u201d\n\n The sources whence the chronicler compiled his work were public records, registers, and genealogical tables belonging to the Jews. These are referred to in the course of the book ([1 Chr. 27:24](/1chr#1Chr.27.24); [29:29](/1chr#1Chr.29.29); [2 Chr. 9:29](/2chr#2Chr.9.29); [12:15](/2chr#2Chr.12.15); [13:22](/2chr#2Chr.13.22); [20:34](/2chr#2Chr.20.34); [24:27](/2chr#2Chr.24.27); [26:22](/2chr#2Chr.26.22); [32:32](/2chr#2Chr.32.32); [33:18](/2chr#2Chr.33.18), [19](/2chr#2Chr.33.19); [27:7](/2chr#2Chr.27.7); [35:25](/2chr#2Chr.35.25)). There are in Chronicles, and the books of Samuel and Kings, forty parallels, often verbal, proving that the writer both knew and used these records ([1 Chr. 17:18](/1chr#1Chr.17.18); comp. [2 Sam. 7:18-20](/2sam#2Sam.7.18); [1 Chr. 19](/1chr#1Chr.19); comp. [2 Sam. 10](/2sam#2Sam.10), etc.).\n\n As compared with Samuel and Kings, the Book of Chronicles omits many particulars there recorded ([2 Sam. 6:20-23](/2sam#2Sam.6.20); [9](/2sam#2Sam.9); [11](/2sam#2Sam.11); 14-19, etc.), and includes many things peculiar to itself ([1 Chr. 12](/1chr#1Chr.12); [22](/1chr#1Chr.22); 23-26; 27; 28; 29, etc.). Twenty whole chapters, and twenty-four parts of chapters, are occupied with matter not found elsewhere. It also records many things in fuller detail, as (e.g.) the list of David\u2019s heroes ([1 Chr. 12:1-37](/1chr#1Chr.12.1)), the removal of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Mount Zion ([1 Chr. 13](/1chr#1Chr.13); [15:2-24](/1chr#1Chr.15.2); [16:4-43](/1chr#1Chr.16.4); comp. [2 Sam. 6](/2sam#2Sam.6)), Uzziah\u2019s leprosy and its cause ([2 Chr. 26:16-21](/2chr#2Chr.26.16); comp. [2 Kings 15:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.5)), etc.\n\n It has also been observed that another peculiarity of the book is that it substitutes modern and more common expressions for those that had then become unusual or obsolete. This is seen particularly in the substitution of modern names of places, such as were in use in the writer\u2019s day, for the old names; thus Gezer ([1 Chr. 20:4](/1chr#1Chr.20.4)) is used instead of Gob ([2 Sam. 21:18](/2sam#2Sam.21.18)), etc.\n\n The Books of Chronicles are ranked among the khethubim or hagiographa. They are alluded to, though not directly quoted, in the New Testament ([Heb. 5:4](/heb#Heb.5.4); [Matt. 12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42); [23:35](/matt#Matt.23.35); [Luke 1:5](/luke#Luke.1.5); [11:31](/luke#Luke.11.31), [51](/luke#Luke.11.51)).",

Like some of his other epistles (e.g., those to Corinth), this seems to have been written in consequence of information which had somehow been conveyed to him of the internal state of the church there ([Col. 1:4-8](/col#Col.1.4)). Its object was to counteract false teaching. A large part of it is directed against certain speculatists who attempted to combine the doctrines of Oriental mysticism and asceticism with Christianity, thereby promising the disciples the enjoyment of a higher spiritual life and a deeper insight into the world of spirits. Paul argues against such teaching, showing that in Christ Jesus they had all things. He sets forth the majesty of his redemption. The mention of the \u201cnew moon\u201d and \u201csabbath days\u201d (2:16) shows also that there were here Judaizing teachers who sought to draw away the disciples from the simplicity of the gospel.\n\n Like most of Paul\u2019s epistles, this consists of two parts, a doctrinal and a practical.",

Many special duties of the Christian life are also insisted upon as the fitting evidence of the Christian character. Tychicus was the bearer of the letter, as he was also of that to the Ephesians and to Philemon, and he would tell them of the state of the apostle (4:7-9). After friendly greetings (10-14), he bids them interchange this letter with that he had sent to the neighbouring church of Laodicea.

These commandments were first given in their written form to the people of Israel when they were encamped at Sinai, about fifty days after they came out of Egypt ([Ex. 19:10-25](/exod#Exod.19.10)). They were written by the finger of God on two tables of stone. The first tables were broken by Moses when he brought them down from the mount (32:19), being thrown by him on the ground. At the command of God he took up into the mount two other tables, and God wrote on them \u201cthe words that were on the first tables\u201d (34:1). These tables were afterwards placed in the ark of the covenant ([Deut. 10:5](/deut#Deut.10.5); [1 Kings 8:9](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.9)). Their subsequent history is unknown. They are as a whole called \u201cthe covenant\u201d ([Deut. 4:13](/deut#Deut.4.13)), and \u201cthe tables of the covenant\u201d (9:9, 11; [Heb. 9:4](/heb#Heb.9.4)), and \u201cthe testimony.\u201d\n\n They are obviously \u201cten\u201d in number, but their division is not fixed, hence different methods of numbering them have been adopted. The Jews make the \u201cPreface\u201d one of the commandments, and then combine the first and second. The Roman Catholics and Lutherans combine the first and second and divide the tenth into two. The Jews and Josephus divide them equally. The Lutherans and Roman Catholics refer three commandments to the first table and seven to the second. The Greek and Reformed Churches refer four to the first and six to the second table. The Samaritans add to the second that Gerizim is the mount of worship. (See LAW.)",

He had heard of the abuses and contentions that had arisen among them, first from Apollos ([Acts 19:1](/acts#Acts.19.1)), and then from a letter they had written him on the subject, and also from some of the \u201chousehold of Chloe,\u201d and from Stephanas and his two friends who had visited him ([1 Cor. 1:11](/1cor#1Cor.1.11); [16:17](/1cor#1Cor.16.17)). Paul thereupon wrote this letter, for the purpose of checking the factious spirit and correcting the erroneous opinions that had sprung up among them, and remedying the many abuses and disorderly practices that prevailed. Titus and a brother whose name is not given were probably the bearers of the letter ([2 Cor. 2:13](/2cor#2Cor.2.13); [8:6](/2cor#2Cor.8.6), [16-18](/2cor#2Cor.8.16)).\n\n The epistle may be divided into four parts:",

It was written, he tells us, in bitter anguish, \u2018out of much affliction and pressure of heart...and with streaming eyes\u2019 ([2 Cor. 2:4](/2cor#2Cor.2.4)); yet he restrained the expression of his feelings, and wrote with a dignity and holy calm which he thought most calculated to win back his erring children. It gives a vivid picture of the early church...It entirely dissipates the dream that the apostolic church was in an exceptional condition of holiness of life or purity of doctrine.\u201d The apostle in this epistle unfolds and applies great principles fitted to guide the church of all ages in dealing with the same and kindred evils in whatever form they may appear.\n\n This is one of the epistles the authenticity of which has never been called in question by critics of any school, so many and so conclusive are the evidences of its Pauline origin.\n\n The subscription to this epistle states erroneously in the Authorized Version that it was written at Philippi. This error arose from a mistranslation of [1 Cor. 16:5](/1cor#1Cor.16.5), \u201cFor I do pass through Macedonia,\u201d which was interpreted as meaning, \u201cI am passing through Macedonia.\u201d In 16:8 he declares his intention of remaining some time longer in Ephesus.

Pursuing the usual route, he reached Troas, the port of departure for Europe. Here he expected to meet with Titus, whom he had sent from Ephesus to Corinth, with tidings of the effects produced on the church there by the first epistle; but was disappointed ([1 Cor. 16:9](/1cor#1Cor.16.9); [2 Cor. 1:8](/2cor#2Cor.1.8); [2:12](/2cor#2Cor.2.12), [13](/2cor#2Cor.2.13)). He then left Troas and proceeded to Macedonia; and at Philippi, where he tarried, he was soon joined by Titus ([2 Cor. 7:6](/2cor#2Cor.7.6), [7](/2cor#2Cor.7.7)), who brought him good news from Corinth, and also by Timothy. Under the influence of the feelings awakened in his mind by the favourable report which Titus brought back from Corinth, this second epistle was written. It was probably written at Philippi, or, as some think, Thessalonica, early in the year A.D. 58, and was sent to Corinth by Titus. This letter he addresses not only to the church in Corinth, but also to the saints in all Achaia, i.e., in Athens, Cenchrea, and other cities in Greece.\n\n The contents of this epistle may be thus arranged:",

The Epistle to the Colossians is mainly polemical, designed to refute certain theosophic errors that had crept into the church there. That to the Ephesians does not seem to have originated in any special circumstances, but is simply a letter springing from Paul\u2019s love to the church there, and indicative of his earnest desire that they should be fully instructed in the profound doctrines of the gospel. It contains (1) the salutation (1:1, 2); (2) a general description of the blessings the gospel reveals, as to their source, means by which they are attained, purpose for which they are bestowed, and their final result, with a fervent prayer for the further spiritual enrichment of the Ephesians (1:3-2:10); (3) \u201ca record of that marked change in spiritual position which the Gentile believers now possessed, ending with an account of the writer\u2019s selection to and qualification for the apostolate of heathendom, a fact so considered as to keep them from being dispirited, and to lead him to pray for enlarged spiritual benefactions on his absent sympathizers\u201d (2:12-3:21); (4) a chapter on unity as undisturbed by diversity of gifts (4:1-16); (5) special injunctions bearing on ordinary life (4:17-6:10); (6) the imagery of a spiritual warfare, mission of Tychicus, and valedictory blessing (6:11-24).\n\n Planting of the church at Ephesus. Paul\u2019s first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in [Acts 18:19-21](/acts#Acts.18.19). The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos (24-26) and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit, early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus \u201cthree years,\u201d for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here \u201ca great door and effectual\u201d was opened to him ([1 Cor. 16:9](/1cor#1Cor.16.9)), and the church was established and strengthened by his assiduous labours there ([Acts 20:20](/acts#Acts.20.20), [31](/acts#Acts.20.31)). From Ephesus as a centre the gospel spread abroad \u201calmost throughout all Asia\u201d (19:26). The word \u201cmightily grew and prevailed\u201d despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.\n\n On his last journey to Jerusalem the apostle landed at Miletus, and summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them his remarkable farewell charge ([Acts 20:18-35](/acts#Acts.20.18)), expecting to see them no more.\n\n The following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced:",

It was evidently written from Rome during Paul\u2019s first imprisonment (3:1; 4:1; 6:20), and probably soon after his arrival there, about the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. The subscription of this epistle is correct.\n\n There seems to have been no special occasion for the writing of this letter, as already noted. Paul\u2019s object was plainly not polemical. No errors had sprung up in the church which he sought to point out and refute. The object of the apostle is \u201cto set forth the ground, the cause, and the aim and end of the church of the faithful in Christ. He speaks to the Ephesians as a type or sample of the church universal.\u201d The church\u2019s foundations, its course, and its end, are his theme. \u201cEverywhere the foundation of the church is the will of the Father; the course of the church is by the satisfaction of the Son; the end of the church is the life in the Holy Spirit.\u201d In the Epistle to the Romans, Paul writes from the point of view of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ; here he writes from the point of view specially of union to the Redeemer, and hence of the oneness of the true church of Christ. \u201cThis is perhaps the profoundest book in existence.\u201d It is a book \u201cwhich sounds the lowest depths of Christian doctrine, and scales the loftiest heights of Christian experience;\u201d and the fact that the apostle evidently expected the Ephesians to understand it is an evidence of the \u201cproficiency which Paul\u2019s converts had attained under his preaching at Ephesus.\u201d\n\n Relation between this epistle and that to the Colossians (q.v.). \u201cThe letters of the apostle are the fervent outburst of pastoral zeal and attachment, written without reserve and in unaffected simplicity; sentiments come warm from the heart, without the shaping out, pruning, and punctilious arrangement of a formal discourse. There is such a fresh and familiar transcription of feeling, so frequent an introduction of coloquial idiom, and so much of conversational frankness and vivacity, that the reader associates the image of the writer with every paragraph, and the ear seems to catch and recognize the very tones of living address.\u201d \u201cIs it then any matter of amazement that one letter should resemble another, or that two written about the same time should have so much in common and so much that is peculiar? The close relation as to style and subject between the epistles to Colosse and Ephesus must strike every reader. Their precise relation to each other has given rise to much discussion. The great probability is that the epistle to Colosse was first written; the parallel passages in Ephesians, which amount to about forty-two in number, having the appearance of being expansions from the epistle to Colosse. Compare:\n\n [Eph 1:7](/eph#Eph.1.7); [Col 1:14](/col#Col.1.14) [Eph 1:10](/eph#Eph.1.10); [Col 1:20](/col#Col.1.20) [Eph 3:2](/eph#Eph.3.2); [Col 1:25](/col#Col.1.25) [Eph 5:19](/eph#Eph.5.19); [Col 3:16](/col#Col.3.16) [Eph 6:22](/eph#Eph.6.22); [Col 4:8](/col#Col.4.8) [Eph 1:19-2:5](/eph#Eph.1.19); [Col 2:12](/col#Col.2.12), [13](/col#Col.2.13) [Eph 4:2-4](/eph#Eph.4.2); [Col 3:12-15](/col#Col.3.12) [Eph 4:16](/eph#Eph.4.16); [Col 2:19](/col#Col.2.19) [Eph 4:32](/eph#Eph.4.32); [Col 3:13](/col#Col.3.13) [Eph 4:22-24](/eph#Eph.4.22); [Col 3:9](/col#Col.3.9), [10](/col#Col.3.10) [Eph 5:6-8](/eph#Eph.5.6); [Col 3:6-8](/col#Col.3.6) [Eph 5:15](/eph#Eph.5.15), [16](/eph#Eph.5.16); [Col 4:5](/col#Col.4.5) [Eph 6:19](/eph#Eph.6.19), [20](/eph#Eph.6.20); [Col 4:3](/col#Col.4.3), [4](/col#Col.4.4) [Eph 5:22-6:9](/eph#Eph.5.22); [Col 3:18-4:1](/col#Col.3.18)\n\u201cThe style of this epistle is exceedingly animated, and corresponds with the state of the apostle\u2019s mind at the time of writing. Overjoyed with the account which their messenger had brought him of their faith and holiness ([Eph. 1:15](/eph#Eph.1.15)), and transported with the consideration of the unsearchable wisdom of God displayed in the work of man\u2019s redemption, and of his astonishing love towards the Gentiles in making them partakers through faith of all the benefits of Christ\u2019s death, he soars high in his sentiments on those grand subjects, and gives his thoughts utterance in sublime and copious expression.\u201d",

The descendants of Joseph formed two of the tribes of Israel, whereas each of the other sons of Jacob was the founder of only one tribe. Thus there were in reality thirteen tribes; but the number twelve was preserved by excluding that of Levi when Ephraim and Manasseh are mentioned separately ([Num. 1:32-34](/num#Num.1.32); [Josh. 17:14](/josh#Josh.17.14), [17](/josh#Josh.17.17); [1 Chr. 7:20](/1chr#1Chr.7.20)).\n\n Territory of. At the time of the first census in the wilderness this tribe numbered 40,500 ([Num. 1:32](/num#Num.1.32), [33](/num#Num.1.33)); forty years later, when about to take possession of the Promised Land, it numbered only 32,500. During the march (see CAMP) Ephraim\u2019s place was on the west side of the tabernacle ([Num. 2:18-24](/num#Num.2.18)). When the spies were sent out to spy the land, \u201cOshea the son of Nun\u201d of this tribe signalized himself.\n\n The boundaries of the portion of the land assigned to Ephraim are given in [Josh. 16:1-10](/josh#Josh.16.1). It included most of what was afterwards called Samaria as distinguished from Judea and Galilee. It thus lay in the centre of all traffic, from north to south, and from Jordan to the sea, and was about 55 miles long and 30 broad. The tabernacle and the ark were deposited within its limits at Shiloh, where it remained for four hundred years. During the time of the judges and the first stage of the monarchy this tribe manifested a domineering and haughty and discontented spirit. \u201cFor more than five hundred years, a period equal to that which elapsed between the Norman Conquest and the War of the Roses, Ephraim, with its two dependent tribes of Manasseh and Benjamin, exercised undisputed pre-eminence. Joshua the first conqueror, Gideon the greatest of the judges, and Saul the first king, belonged to one or other of the three tribes. It was not till the close of the first period of Jewish history that God \u2018refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved\u2019 ([Ps. 78:67](/ps#Ps.78.67), [68](/ps#Ps.78.68)). When the ark was removed from Shiloh to Zion the power of Ephraim was humbled.\u201d\n\n Among the causes which operated to bring about the disruption of Israel was Ephraim\u2019s jealousy of the growing power of Judah. From the settlement of Canaan till the time of David and Solomon, Ephraim had held the place of honour among the tribes. It occupied the central and fairest portions of the land, and had Shiloh and Shechem within its borders. But now when Jerusalem became the capital of the kingdom, and the centre of power and worship for the whole nation of Israel, Ephraim declined in influence. The discontent came to a crisis by Rehoboam\u2019s refusal to grant certain redresses that were demanded ([1 Kings 12](/1kgs#1Kgs.12)).",

            "dictText": "The genuineness of this epistle is not called in question. Its Pauline origin is universally acknowledged.\n\n Occasion of. The churches of Galatia were founded by Paul himself ([Acts 16:6](/acts#Acts.16.6); [Gal. 1:8](/gal#Gal.1.8); [4:13](/gal#Gal.4.13), [19](/gal#Gal.4.19)). They seem to have been composed mainly of converts from heathenism (4:8), but partly also of Jewish converts, who probably, under the influence of Judaizing teachers, sought to incorporate the rites of Judaism with Christianity, and by their active zeal had succeeded in inducing the majority of the churches to adopt their views (1:6; 3:1). This epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting this Judaizing tendency, and of recalling the Galatians to the simplicity of the gospel, and at the same time also of vindicating Paul\u2019s claim to be a divinely-commissioned apostle.\n\n Time and place of writing. The epistle was probably written very soon after Paul\u2019s second visit to Galatia ([Acts 18:23](/acts#Acts.18.23)). The references of the epistle appear to agree with this conclusion. The visit to Jerusalem, mentioned in [Gal. 2:1-10](/gal#Gal.2.1), was identical with that of [Acts 15](/acts#Acts.15), and it is spoken of as a thing of the past, and consequently the epistle was written subsequently to the council of Jerusalem. The similarity between this epistle and that to the Romans has led to the conclusion that they were both written at the same time, namely, in the winter of A.D. 57-8, during Paul\u2019s stay in Corinth ([Acts 20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2), [3](/acts#Acts.20.3)). This to the Galatians is written on the urgency of the occasion, tidings having reached him of the state of matters; and that to the Romans in a more deliberate and systematic way, in exposition of the same great doctrines of the gospel.\n\n Contents of. The great question discussed is, Was the Jewish law binding on Christians? The epistle is designed to prove against the Jews that men are justified by faith without the works of the law of Moses. After an introductory address ([Gal. 1:1-10](/gal#Gal.1.1)) the apostle discusses the subjects which had occasioned the epistle. (1) He defends his apostolic authority (1:11-19; 2:1-14); (2) shows the evil influence of the Judaizers in destroying the very essence of the gospel (3 and 4); (3) exhorts the Galatian believers to stand fast in the faith as it is in Jesus, and to abound in the fruits of the Spirit, and in a right use of their Christian freedom (5-6:1-10); (4) and then concludes with a summary of the topics discussed, and with the benediction.\n\n The Epistle to the Galatians and that to the Romans taken together \u201cform a complete proof that justification is not to be obtained meritoriously either by works of morality or by rites and ceremonies, though of divine appointment; but that it is a free gift, proceeding entirely from the mercy of God, to those who receive it by faith in Jesus our Lord.\u201d\n\n In the conclusion of the epistle (6:11) Paul says, \u201cYe see how large a letter I have written with mine own hand.\u201d It is implied that this was different from his ordinary usage, which was simply to write the concluding salutation with his own hand, indicating that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand. Regarding this conclusion, Lightfoot, in his Commentary on the epistle, says: \u201cAt this point the apostle takes the pen from his amanuensis, and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ([2 Thess. 2:2](/2thess#2Thess.2.2); [3:17](/2thess#2Thess.3.17)) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries...In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. pelikois grammasin), that his hand-writing may reflect the energy and determination of his soul.\u201d (See JUSTIFICATION.)",

The modern Arabs retain this name, Bahr Tabariyeh.\n\n This lake is 12 1/2 miles long, and from 4 to 7 1/2 broad. Its surface is 682 feet below the level of the Mediterranean. Its depth is from 80 to 160 feet. The Jordan enters it 10 1/2 miles below the southern extremity of the Huleh Lake, or about 26 1/2 miles from its source. In this distance of 26 1/2 miles there is a fall in the river of 1,682 feet, or of more than 60 feet to the mile. It is 27 miles east of the Mediterranean, and about 60 miles north-east of Jerusalem. It is of an oval shape, and abounds in fish.\n\n Its present appearance is thus described: \u201cThe utter loneliness and absolute stillness of the scene are exceedingly impressive. It seems as if all nature had gone to rest, languishing under the scorching heat. How different it was in the days of our Lord! Then all was life and bustle along the shores; the cities and villages that thickly studded them resounded with the hum of a busy population; while from hill-side and corn-field came the cheerful cry of shepherd and ploughman. The lake, too, was dotted with dark fishing-boats and spangled with white sails. Now a mournful, solitary silence reigns over sea and shore. The cities are in ruins!\u201d\n\n This sea is chiefly of interest as associated with the public ministry of our Lord. Capernaum, \u201chis own city\u201d ([Matt. 9:1](/matt#Matt.9.1)), stood on its shores. From among the fishermen who plied their calling on its waters he chose Peter and his brother Andrew, and James and John, to be disciples, and sent them forth to be \u201cfishers of men\u201d ([Matt. 4:18](/matt#Matt.4.18), [22](/matt#Matt.4.22); [Mark 1:16-20](/mark#Mark.1.16); [Luke 5](/luke#Luke.5): 1-11). He stilled its tempest, saying to the storm that swept over it, \u201cPeace, be still\u201d ([Matt. 8:23-27](/matt#Matt.8.23); [Mark 7:31-35](/mark#Mark.7.31)); and here also he showed himself after his resurrection to his disciples ([John 21](/john#John.21)).\n\n \u201cThe Sea of Galilee is indeed the cradle of the gospel. The subterranean fires of nature prepared a lake basin, through which a river afterwards ran, keeping its waters always fresh. In this basin a vast quantity of shell-fish swarmed, and multiplied to such an extent that they formed the food of an extraordinary profusion of fish. The great variety and abundance of the fish in the lake attracted to its shores a larger and more varied population than existed elsewhere in Palestine, whereby this secluded district was brought into contact with all parts of the world. And this large and varied population, with access to all nations and countries, attracted the Lord Jesus, and induced him to make this spot the centre of his public ministry.\u201d",

Hosea prophesied in a dark and melancholy period of Israel\u2019s history, the period of Israel\u2019s decline and fall. Their sins had brought upon them great national disasters. \u201cTheir homicides and fornication, their perjury and theft, their idolatry and impiety, are censured and satirized with a faithful severity.\u201d He was a contemporary of Isaiah. The book may be divided into two parts, the first containing chapters 1-3, and symbolically representing the idolatry of Israel under imagery borrowed from the matrimonial relation. The figures of marriage and adultery are common in the Old Testament writings to represent the spiritual relations between Jehovah and the people of Israel. Here we see the apostasy of Israel and their punishment, with their future repentance, forgiveness, and restoration.\n\n The second part, containing 4-14, is a summary of Hosea\u2019s discourses, filled with denunciations, threatenings, exhortations, promises, and revelations of mercy.\n\n Quotations from Hosea are found in [Matt. 2:15](/matt#Matt.2.15); [9:15](/matt#Matt.9.15); [12:7](/matt#Matt.12.7); [Rom. 9:25](/rom#Rom.9.25), [26](/rom#Rom.9.26).

[Hos. 1:10](/hos#Hos.1.10), etc.).\n\n As regards the style of this writer, it has been said that \u201ceach verse forms a whole for itself, like one heavy toll in a funeral knell.\u201d \u201cInversions (7:8; 9:11, 13; 12: 8), anacolutha (9:6; 12:8, etc.), ellipses (9:4; 13:9, etc.), paranomasias, and plays upon words, are very characteristic of Hosea (8:7; 9:15; 10:5; 11:5; 12:11).\u201d",

But even granting the fact of a great diversity of style and language, this will not necessitate the conclusion attempted to be drawn from it. The diversity of subjects treated of and the peculiarities of the prophet\u2019s position at the time the prophecies were uttered will sufficiently account for this.\n\n The arguments in favour of the unity of the book are quite conclusive. When the LXX. version was made (about B.C. 250) the entire contents of the book were ascribed to Isaiah, the son of Amoz. It is not called in question, moreover, that in the time of our Lord the book existed in the form in which we now have it. Many prophecies in the disputed portions are quoted in the New Testament as the words of Isaiah ([Matt. 3:3](/matt#Matt.3.3); [Luke 3:4-6](/luke#Luke.3.4); [4:16-41](/luke#Luke.4.16); [John 12:38](/john#John.12.38); [Acts 8:28](/acts#Acts.8.28); [Rom. 10:16-21](/rom#Rom.10.16)). Universal and persistent tradition has ascribed the whole book to one author.\n\n Besides this, the internal evidence, the similarity in the language and style, in the thoughts and images and rhetorical ornaments, all points to the same conclusion; and its local colouring and allusions show that it is obviously of Palestinian origin. The theory therefore of a double authorship of the book, much less of a manifold authorship, cannot be maintained. The book, with all the diversity of its contents, is one, and is, we believe, the production of the great prophet whose name it bears.",

Rehoboam, the son and successor of Solomon, was scarcely seated on his throne when the old jealousies between Judah and the other tribes broke out anew, and Jeroboam was sent for from Egypt by the malcontents (12:2, 3). Rehoboam insolently refused to lighten the burdensome taxation and services which his father had imposed on his subjects (12:4), and the rebellion became complete. Ephraim and all Israel raised the old cry, \u201cEvery man to his tents, O Israel\u201d ([2 Sam. 20:1](/2sam#2Sam.20.1)). Rehoboam fled to Jerusalem ([1 Kings 12:1-18](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.1); [2 Chr. 10](/2chr#2Chr.10)), and Jeroboam was proclaimed king over all Israel at Shechem, Judah and Benjamin remaining faithful to Solomon\u2019s son. War, with varying success, was carried on between the two kingdoms for about sixty years, till Jehoshaphat entered into an alliance with the house of Ahab.\n\n Extent of the kingdom. In the time of Solomon the area of Palestine, excluding the Phoenician territories on the shore of the Mediterranean, did not much exceed 13,000 square miles. The kingdom of Israel comprehended about 9,375 square miles. Shechem was the first capital of this kingdom ([1 Kings 12:25](/1kgs#1Kgs.12.25)), afterwards Tirza (14:17). Samaria was subsequently chosen as the capital (16:24), and continued to be so till the destruction of the kingdom by the Assyrians ([2 Kings 17:5](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.5)). During the siege of Samaria (which lasted for three years) by the Assyrians, Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon, who himself thus records the capture of that city: \u201cSamaria I looked at, I captured; 27,280 men who dwelt in it I carried away\u201d ([2 Kings 17:6](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.6)) into Assyria. Thus after a duration of two hundred and fifty-three years the kingdom of the ten tribes came to an end. They were scattered throughout the East. (See CAPTIVITY.)\n\n \u201cJudah held its ground against Assyria for yet one hundred and twenty-three years, and became the rallying-point of the dispersed of every tribe, and eventually gave its name to the whole race. Those of the people who in the last struggle escaped into the territories of Judah or other neighbouring countries naturally looked to Judah as the head and home of their race. And when Judah itself was carried off to Babylon, many of the exiled Israelites joined them from Assyria, and swelled that immense population which made Babylonia a second Palestine.\u201d\n\n After the deportation of the ten tribes, the deserted land was colonized by various eastern tribes, whom the king of Assyria sent thither ([Ezra 4:2](/ezra#Ezra.4.2), [10](/ezra#Ezra.4.10); [2 Kings 17:24-29](/2kgs#2Kgs.17.24)). (See KINGS.)\n\n In contrast with the kingdom of Judah is that of Israel.",

The great lesson which he teaches them as Christians is patience, patience in trial (1:2), patience in good works (1:22-25), patience under provocation (3:17), patience under oppression (5:7), patience under persecution (5:10); and the ground of their patience is that the coming of the Lord draweth nigh, which is to right all wrong (5:8).\u201d\n\n \u201cJustification by works,\u201d which James contends for, is justification before man, the justification of our profession of faith by a consistent life.

From internal evidence, such as the similarity of sentiment and language to those in the Psalms and Proverbs (see [Ps. 88](/ps#Ps.88) and 89), the prevalence of the idea of \u201cwisdom,\u201d and the style and character of the composition, it is supposed by some to have been written in the time of David and Solomon. Others argue that it was written by Job himself, or by Elihu, or Isaiah, or perhaps more probably by Moses, who was \u201clearned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and mighty in words and deeds\u201d ([Acts 7:22](/acts#Acts.7.22)). He had opportunities in Midian for obtaining the knowledge of the facts related. But the authorship is altogether uncertain.\n\n As to the character of the book, it is a historical poem, one of the greatest and sublimest poems in all literature. Job was a historical person, and the localities and names were real and not fictious. It is \u201cone of the grandest portions of the inspired Scriptures, a heavenly-repleished storehouse of comfort and instruction, the patriarchal Bible, and a precious monument of primitive theology. It is to the Old Testament what the Epistle to the Romans is to the New.\u201d It is a didactic narrative in a dramatic form.\n\n This book was apparently well known in the days of Ezekiel, B.C. 600 ([Ezek. 14:14](/ezek#Ezek.14.14)). It formed a part of the sacred Scriptures used by our Lord and his apostles, and is referred to as a part of the inspired Word ([Heb. 12:5](/heb#Heb.12.5); [1 Cor. 3:19](/1cor#1Cor.3.19)).\n\n The subject of the book is the trial of Job, its occasion, nature, endurance, and issue. It exhibits the harmony of the truths of revelation and the dealings of Providence, which are seen to be at once inscrutable, just, and merciful. It shows the blessedness of the truly pious, even amid sore afflictions, and thus ministers comfort and hope to tried believers of every age. It is a book of manifold instruction, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness ([2 Tim. 3:16](/2tim#2Tim.3.16)).\n\n It consists of,",

In recent times, from about 1820, many attempts have been made to impugn its genuineness, but without success.\n\n The design of John in writing this Gospel is stated by himself ([John 20:31](/john#John.20.31)). It was at one time supposed that he wrote for the purpose of supplying the omissions of the synoptical, i.e., of the first three, Gospels, but there is no evidence for this. \u201cThere is here no history of Jesus and his teaching after the manner of the other evangelists. But there is in historical form a representation of the Christian faith in relation to the person of Christ as its central point; and in this representation there is a picture on the one hand of the antagonism of the world to the truth revealed in him, and on the other of the spiritual blessedness of the few who yield themselves to him as the Light of life\u201d (Reuss).\n\n After the prologue (1:1-5), the historical part of the book begins with verse 6, and consists of two parts. The first part (1:6-ch. 12) contains the history of our Lord\u2019s public ministry from the time of his introduction to it by John the Baptist to its close. The second part (ch. 13-21) presents our Lord in the retirement of private life and in his intercourse with his immediate followers (13-17), and gives an account of his sufferings and of his appearances to the disciples after his resurrection (18-21).\n\n The peculiarities of this Gospel are the place it gives (1) to the mystical relation of the Son to the Father, and (2) of the Redeemer to believers; (3) the announcement of the Holy Ghost as the Comforter; (4) the prominence given to love as an element in the Christian character. It was obviously addressed primarily to Christians.\n\n It was probably written at Ephesus, which, after the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), became the centre of Christian life and activity in the East, about A.D. 90.",

Some critics have sought to interpret the book as a parable or allegory, and not as a history. They have done so for various reasons. Thus (1) some reject it on the ground that the miraculous element enters so largely into it, and that it is not prophetical but narrative in its form; (2) others, denying the possibility of miracles altogether, hold that therefore it cannot be true history.\n\n Jonah and his story is referred to by our Lord ([Matt. 12:39](/matt#Matt.12.39), [40](/matt#Matt.12.40); [Luke 11:29](/luke#Luke.11.29)), a fact to which the greatest weight must be attached. It is impossible to interpret this reference on any other theory. This one argument is of sufficient importance to settle the whole question. No theories devised for the purpose of getting rid of difficulties can stand against such a proof that the book is a veritable history.\n\n There is every reason to believe that this book was written by Jonah himself. It gives an account of (1) his divine commission to go to Nineveh, his disobedience, and the punishment following (1:1-17); (2) his prayer and miraculous deliverance (1:17-2:10); (3) the second commission given to him, and his prompt obedience in delivering the message from God, and its results in the repentance of the Ninevites, and God\u2019s long-sparing mercy toward them (ch. 3); (4) Jonah\u2019s displeasure at God\u2019s merciful decision, and the rebuke tendered to the impatient prophet (ch. 4). Nineveh was spared after Jonah\u2019s mission for more than a century. The history of Jonah may well be regarded \u201cas a part of that great onward movement which was before the Law and under the Law; which gained strength and volume as the fulness of the times drew near.\u201d, Perowne\u2019s Jonah.",

The Canaanites had sunk into a state of immorality and corruption so foul and degrading that they had to be rooted out of the land with the edge of the sword. \u201cThe Israelites\u2019 sword, in its bloodiest executions, wrought a work of mercy for all the countries of the earth to the very end of the world.\u201d\n\n This book resembles the Acts of the Apostles in the number and variety of historical incidents it records, and in its many references to persons and places; and as in the latter case the epistles of Paul (see Paley\u2019s Horae Paul.) confirm its historical accuracy by their incidental allusions and \u201cundesigned coincidences,\u201d so in the former modern discoveries confirm its historicity. The Amarna tablets (see  ADONIZEDEC) are among the most remarkable discoveries of the age. Dating from about B.C. 1480 down to the time of Joshua, and consisting of official communications from Amorite, Phoenician, and Philistine chiefs to the king of Egypt, they afford a glimpse into the actual condition of Palestine prior to the Hebrew invasion, and illustrate and confirm the history of the conquest. A letter, also still extant, from a military officer, \u201cmaster of the captains of Egypt,\u201d dating from near the end of the reign of Rameses II., gives a curious account of a journey, probably official, which he undertook through Palestine as far north as to Aleppo, and an insight into the social condition of the country at that time. Among the things brought to light by this letter and the Amarna tablets is the state of confusion and decay that had now fallen on Egypt. The Egyptian garrisons that had held possession of Palestine from the time of Thothmes III., some two hundred years before, had now been withdrawn. The way was thus opened for the Hebrews. In the history of the conquest there is no mention of Joshua having encountered any Egyptian force. The tablets contain many appeals to the king of Egypt for help against the inroads of the Hebrews, but no help seems ever to have been sent. Is not this just such a state of things as might have been anticipated as the result of the disaster of the Exodus? In many points, as shown under various articles, the progress of the conquest is remarkably illustrated by the tablets. The value of modern discoveries in their relation to Old Testament history has been thus well described:\n\n \u201cThe difficulty of establishing the charge of lack of historical credibility, as against the testimony of the Old Testament, has of late years greatly increased. The outcome of recent excavations and explorations is altogether against it. As long as these books contained, in the main, the only known accounts of the events they mention, there was some plausibility in the theory that perhaps these accounts were written rather to teach moral lessons than to preserve an exact knowledge of events. It was easy to say in those times men had not the historic sense. But the recent discoveries touch the events recorded in the Bible at very many different points in many different generations, mentioning the same persons, countries, peoples, events that are mentioned in the Bible, and showing beyond question that these were strictly historic. The point is not that the discoveries confirm the correctness of the Biblical statements, though that is commonly the case, but that the discoveries show that the peoples of those ages had the historic sense, and, specifically, that the Biblical narratives they touch are narratives of actual occurrences.\u201d",

For about another century and a half Judah had a somewhat checkered existence after the termination of the kingdom of Israel till its final overthrow in the destruction of the temple (B.C. 588) by Nebuzar-adan, who was captain of Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s body-guard ([2 Kings 25:8-21](/2kgs#2Kgs.25.8)).\n\n The kingdom maintained a separate existence for three hundred and eighty-nine years. It occupied an area of 3,435 square miles. (See ISRAEL, KINGDOM OF.)",

The genuineness of this epistle was early questioned, and doubts regarding it were revived at the time of the Reformation; but the evidences in support of its claims are complete. It has all the marks of having proceeded from the writer whose name it bears.\n\n There is nothing very definite to determine the time and place at which it was written. It was apparently written in the later period of the apostolic age, for when it was written there were persons still alive who had heard the apostles preach (ver. 17). It may thus have been written about A.D. 66 or 70, and apparently in Palestine.\n\n The epistle is addressed to Christians in general (ver. 1), and its design is to put them on their guard against the misleading efforts of a certain class of errorists to which they were exposed. The style of the epistle is that of an \u201cimpassioned invective, in the impetuous whirlwind of which the writer is hurried along, collecting example after example of divine vengeance on the ungodly; heaping epithet upon epithet, and piling image upon image, and, as it were, labouring for words and images strong enough to depict the polluted character of the licentious apostates against whom he is warning the Church; returning again and again to the subject, as though all language was insufficient to give an adequate idea of their profligacy, and to express his burning hatred of their perversion of the doctrines of the gospel.\u201d\n\n The striking resemblance this epistle bears to 2 Peter suggests the idea that the author of the one had seen the epistle of the other.\n\n The doxology with which the epistle concludes is regarded as the finest in the New Testament.",

While in the Chronicles greater prominence is given to the priestly or Levitical office, in the Kings greater prominence is given to the kingly.\n\n The authorship of these books is uncertain. There are some portions of them and of Jeremiah that are almost identical, e.g., [2 Kings 24:18-25](/2kgs#2Kgs.24.18) and [Jer. 52](/jer#Jer.52); [39:1-10](/jer#Jer.39.1); [40:7-41:10](/jer#Jer.40.7). There are also many undesigned coincidences between Jeremiah and Kings ([2 Kings 21](/2kgs#2Kgs.21)-23 and [Jer. 7:15](/jer#Jer.7.15); [15:4](/jer#Jer.15.4); [19:3](/jer#Jer.19.3), etc.), and events recorded in Kings of which Jeremiah had personal knowledge. These facts countenance in some degree the tradition that Jeremiah was the author of the books of Kings. But the more probable supposition is that Ezra, after the Captivity, compiled them from documents written perhaps by David, Solomon, Nathan, Gad, and Iddo, and that he arranged them in the order in which they now exist.\n\n In the threefold division of the Scriptures by the Jews, these books are ranked among the \u201cProphets.\u201d They are frequently quoted or alluded to by our Lord and his apostles ([Matt. 6:29](/matt#Matt.6.29); [12:42](/matt#Matt.12.42); [Luke 4:25](/luke#Luke.4.25), [26](/luke#Luke.4.26); 10:4; comp. [2 Kings 4:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.4.29); [Mark 1:6](/mark#Mark.1.6); comp. [2 Kings 1:8](/2kgs#2Kgs.1.8); [Matt. 3:4](/matt#Matt.3.4), etc.).\n\n The sources of the narrative are referred to (1) \u201cthe book of the acts of Solomon\u201d ([1 Kings 11:41](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.41)); (2) the \u201cbook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah\u201d (14:29; 15:7, 23, etc.); (3) the \u201cbook of the chronicles of the kings of Israel\u201d (14:19; 15:31; 16:14, 20, 27, etc.).\n\n The date of its composition was some time between B.C. 561, the date of the last chapter ([2 Kings 25](/2kgs#2Kgs.25)), when Jehoiachin was released from captivity by Evil-merodach, and B.C. 538, the date of the decree of deliverance by Cyrus.",

            "dictText": "Called in the Hebrew canon \u2019Ekhah, meaning \u201cHow,\u201d being the formula for the commencement of a song of wailing. It is the first word of the book (see [2 Sam. 1:19-27](/2sam#2Sam.1.19)). The LXX. adopted the name rendered \u201cLamentations\u201d (Gr. threnoi = Heb. qinoth) now in common use, to denote the character of the book, in which the prophet mourns over the desolations brought on the city and the holy land by Chaldeans. In the Hebrew Bible it is placed among the Khethubim. (See BIBLE.)\n\n As to its authorship, there is no room for hesitancy in following the LXX. and the Targum in ascribing it to Jeremiah. The spirit, tone, language, and subject-matter are in accord with the testimony of tradition in assigning it to him. According to tradition, he retired after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar to a cavern outside the Damascus gate, where he wrote this book. That cavern is still pointed out. \u201cIn the face of a rocky hill, on the western side of the city, the local belief has placed \u2018the grotto of Jeremiah.\u2019 There, in that fixed attitude of grief which Michael Angelo has immortalized, the prophet may well be supposed to have mourned the fall of his country\u201d (Stanley, Jewish Church).\n\n The book consists of five separate poems. In chapter 1 the prophet dwells on the manifold miseries oppressed by which the city sits as a solitary widow weeping sorely. In chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with the national sins that had caused them. Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God. The chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them. Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation that had come upon the city and temple, but traces it only to the people\u2019s sins. Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion\u2019s reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people.\n\n The first four poems (chapters) are acrostics, like some of the Psalms (25, 34, 37, 119), i.e., each verse begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet taken in order. The first, second, and fourth have each twenty-two verses, the number of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet. The third has sixty-six verses, in which each three successive verses begin with the same letter. The fifth is not acrostic.\n\n Speaking of the \u201cWailing-place (q.v.) of the Jews\u201d at Jerusalem, a portion of the old wall of the temple of Solomon, Schaff says: \u201cThere the Jews assemble every Friday afternoon to bewail the downfall of the holy city, kissing the stone wall and watering it with their tears. They repeat from their well-worn Hebrew Bibles and prayer-books the Lamentations of Jeremiah and suitable Psalms.\u201d",

            "dictText": "Was written by Luke. He does not claim to have been an eye-witness of our Lord\u2019s ministry, but to have gone to the best sources of information within his reach, and to have written an orderly narrative of the facts ([Luke 1:1-4](/luke#Luke.1.1)). The authors of the first three Gospels, the synoptics, wrote independently of each other. Each wrote his independent narrative under the guidance of the Holy Spirit.\n\n Each writer has some things, both in matter and style, peculiar to himself, yet all the three have much in common. Luke\u2019s Gospel has been called \u201cthe Gospel of the nations, full of mercy and hope, assured to the world by the love of a suffering Saviour;\u201d \u201cthe Gospel of the saintly life;\u201d \u201cthe Gospel for the Greeks; the Gospel of the future; the Gospel of progressive Christianity, of the universality and gratuitousness of the gospel; the historic Gospel; the Gospel of Jesus as the good Physician and the Saviour of mankind;\u201d the \u201cGospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man;\u201d \u201cthe Gospel of womanhood;\u201d \u201cthe Gospel of the outcast, of the Samaritan, the publican, the harlot, and the prodigal;\u201d \u201cthe Gospel of tolerance.\u201d The main characteristic of this Gospel, as Farrar (Cambridge Bible, Luke, Introd.) remarks, is fitly expressed in the motto, \u201cWho went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil\u201d ([Acts 10:38](/acts#Acts.10.38); comp. [Luke 4:18](/luke#Luke.4.18)). Luke wrote for the \u201cHellenic world.\u201d This Gospel is indeed \u201crich and precious.\u201d\n\n \u201cOut of a total of 1151 verses, Luke has 389 in common with Matthew and Mark, 176 in common with Matthew alone, 41 in common with Mark alone, leaving 544 peculiar to himself. In many instances all three use identical language.\u201d (See  MATTHEW;  MARK; GOSPELS.)\n\n There are seventeen of our Lord\u2019s parables peculiar to this Gospel. (See List of Parables in Appendix.) Luke also records seven of our Lord\u2019s miracles which are omitted by Matthew and Mark. (See List of Miracles in Appendix.) The synoptical Gospels are related to each other after the following scheme. If the contents of each Gospel be represented by 100, then when compared this result is obtained:\n\n Mark has 7 peculiarities, 93 coincidences.  [Matthew 42](/matt#Matt.42) peculiarities, 58 coincidences.  [Luke 59](/luke#Luke.59) peculiarities, 41 coincidences.\n\n That is, thirteen-fourteenths of Mark, four-sevenths of Matthew, and two-fifths of Luke are taken up in describing the same things in very similar language.\n\n Luke\u2019s style is more finished and classical than that of Matthew and Mark. There is less in it of the Hebrew idiom. He uses a few Latin words ([Luke 12:6](/luke#Luke.12.6); [7:41](/luke#Luke.7.41); [8:30](/luke#Luke.8.30); [11:33](/luke#Luke.11.33); [19:20](/luke#Luke.19.20)), but no Syriac or Hebrew words except sikera, an exciting drink of the nature of wine, but not made of grapes (from Heb. shakar, \u201che is intoxicated\u201d, [Lev. 10:9](/lev#Lev.10.9)), probably palm wine.\n\n This Gospel contains twenty-eight distinct references to the Old Testament.\n\n The date of its composition is uncertain. It must have been written before the Acts, the date of the composition of which is generally fixed at about 63 or 64 A.D. This Gospel was written, therefore, probably about 60 or 63, when Luke may have been at Caesarea in attendance on Paul, who was then a prisoner. Others have conjectured that it was written at Rome during Paul\u2019s imprisonment there. But on this point no positive certainty can be attained.\n\n It is commonly supposed that Luke wrote under the direction, if not at the dictation of Paul. Many words and phrases are common to both; e.g., compare:\n\n [Luke 4:22](/luke#Luke.4.22); with [Col. 4:6](/col#Col.4.6).  [Luke 4:32](/luke#Luke.4.32); with [1 Cor. 2:4](/1cor#1Cor.2.4).

In his mother\u2019s house he would have abundant opportunities of obtaining information from the other apostles and their coadjutors, yet he was \u201cthe disciple and interpreter of Peter\u201d specially.\n\n As to the time when it was written, the Gospel furnishes us with no definite information. Mark makes no mention of the destruction of Jerusalem, hence it must have been written before that event, and probably about A.D. 63.\n\n The place where it was written was probably Rome. Some have supposed Antioch (comp. [Mark 15:21](/mark#Mark.15.21) with [Acts 11:20](/acts#Acts.11.20)).\n\n It was intended primarily for Romans. This appears probable when it is considered that it makes no reference to the Jewish law, and that the writer takes care to interpret words which a Gentile would be likely to misunderstand, such as, \u201cBoanerges\u201d (3:17); \u201cTalitha cumi\u201d (5:41); \u201cCorban\u201d (7:11); \u201cBartimaeus\u201d (10:46); \u201cAbba\u201d (14:36); \u201cEloi,\u201d etc. (15:34). Jewish usages are also explained (7:3; 14:3; 14:12; 15:42). Mark also uses certain Latin words not found in any of the other Gospels, as \u201cspeculator\u201d (6:27, rendered, A.V., \u201cexecutioner;\u201d R.V., \u201csoldier of his guard\u201d), \u201cxestes\u201d (a corruption of sextarius, rendered \u201cpots,\u201d 7:4, 8), \u201cquadrans\u201d (12:42, rendered \u201ca farthing\u201d), \u201ccenturion\u201d (15:39, 44, 45). He only twice quotes from the Old Testament (1:2; 15:28).\n\n The characteristics of this Gospel are, (1) the absence of the genealogy of our Lord, (2) whom he represents as clothed with power, the \u201clion of the tribe of Judah.\u201d",

            "dictText": "The author of this book was beyond a doubt the Matthew, an apostle of our Lord, whose name it bears. He wrote the Gospel of Christ according to his own plans and aims, and from his own point of view, as did also the other \u201cevangelists.\u201d\n\n As to the time of its composition, there is little in the Gospel itself to indicate. It was evidently written before the destruction of Jerusalem ([Matt. 24](/matt#Matt.24)), and some time after the events it records. The probability is that it was written between the years A.D. 60 and 65.\n\n The cast of thought and the forms of expression employed by the writer show that this Gospel was written for Jewish Christians of Palestine. His great object is to prove that Jesus of Nazareth was the promised Messiah, and that in him the ancient prophecies had their fulfilment. The Gospel is full of allusions to those passages of the Old Testament in which Christ is predicted and foreshadowed. The one aim prevading the whole book is to show that Jesus is he \u201cof whom Moses in the law and the prophets did write.\u201d This Gospel contains no fewer than sixty-five references to the Old Testament, forty-three of these being direct verbal citations, thus greatly outnumbering those found in the other Gospels. The main feature of this Gospel may be expressed in the motto, \u201cI am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.\u201d\n\n As to the language in which this Gospel was written there is much controversy. Many hold, in accordance with old tradition, that it was originally written in Hebrew (i.e., the Aramaic or Syro-Chaldee dialect, then the vernacular of the inhabitants of Palestine), and afterwards translated into Greek, either by Matthew himself or by some person unknown. This theory, though earnestly maintained by able critics, we cannot see any ground for adopting. From the first this Gospel in Greek was received as of authority in the Church. There is nothing in it to show that it is a translation. Though Matthew wrote mainly for the Jews, yet they were everywhere familiar with the Greek language. The same reasons which would have suggested the necessity of a translation into Greek would have led the evangelist to write in Greek at first. It is confessed that this Gospel has never been found in any other form than that in which we now possess it.\n\n The leading characteristic of this Gospel is that it sets forth the kingly glory of Christ, and shows him to be the true heir to David\u2019s throne. It is the Gospel of the kingdom. Matthew uses the expression \u201ckingdom of heaven\u201d (thirty-two times), while Luke uses the expression \u201ckingdom of God\u201d (thirty-three times). Some Latinized forms occur in this Gospel, as kodrantes ([Matt. 5:26](/matt#Matt.5.26)), for the Latin quadrans, and phragello (27:26), for the Latin flagello. It must be remembered that Matthew was a tax-gatherer for the Roman government, and hence in contact with those using the Latin language.\n\n As to the relation of the Gospels to each other, we must maintain that each writer of the synoptics (the first three) wrote independently of the other two, Matthew being probably first in point of time.\n\n \u201cOut of a total of 1071 verses, Matthew has 387 in common with Mark and Luke, 130 with Mark, 184 with Luke; only 387 being peculiar to itself.\u201d (See MARK;  LUKE; GOSPELS.)\n\n The book is fitly divided into these four parts:",

It has been noticed as remarkable that this book commences with the last words of another prophet, \u201cMicaiah the son of Imlah\u201d ([1 Kings 22:28](/1kgs#1Kgs.22.28)): \u201cHearken, O people, every one of you.\u201d\n\n The book consists of three sections, each commencing with a rebuke, \u201cHear ye,\u201d etc., and closing with a promise, (1) ch. 1; 2; (2) ch. 3-5, especially addressed to the princes and heads of the people; (3) ch. 6-7, in which Jehovah is represented as holding a controversy with his people: the whole concluding with a song of triumph at the great deliverance which the Lord will achieve for his people.

This is the more probable opinion, internal evidences leading to that conclusion. Probably the book was written in Jerusalem (soon after B.C. 709), where he witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host ([2 Kings 19:35](/2kgs#2Kgs.19.35)).\n\n The subject of this prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of Nineveh, the capital of the great and at that time flourishing Assyrian empire. Assur-bani-pal was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the centre of the civilzation and commerce of the world, a \u201cbloody city all full of lies and robbery\u201d ([Nah. 3:1](/nah#Nah.3.1)), for it had robbed and plundered all the neighbouring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy; yet it was to be utterly destroyed as a punishment for the great wickedness of its inhabitants.\n\n Jonah had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by Zephaniah, who also predicted ([Zeph. 2:4-15](/zeph#Zeph.2.4)) the destruction of the city, predictions which were remarkably fulfilled (B.C. 625) when Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.

It was intended thus to set forth under poetic imagery the future character and history of the tribe.\n\n At the time of the Exodus this tribe numbered 53,400 adult males ([Num. 1:43](/num#Num.1.43)), but at the close of the wanderings they numbered only 45,400 (26:48-50). Along with Dan and Asher they formed \u201cthe camp of Dan,\u201d under a common standard (2:25-31), occupying a place during the march on the north side of the tabernacle.\n\n The possession assigned to this tribe is set forth in [Josh. 19:32-39](/josh#Josh.19.32). It lay in the north-eastern corner of the land, bounded on the east by the Jordan and the lakes of Merom and Galilee, and on the north it extended far into Coele-Syria, the valley between the two Lebanon ranges. It comprehended a greater variety of rich and beautiful scenery and of soil and climate than fell to the lot of any other tribe. The territory of Naphtali extended to about 800 square miles, being the double of that of Issachar. The region around Kedesh, one of its towns, was originally called Galil, a name afterwards given to the whole northern division of Canaan. A large number of foreigners settled here among the mountains, and hence it was called \u201cGalilee of the Gentiles\u201d (q.v.), [Matt. 4:15](/matt#Matt.4.15), [16](/matt#Matt.4.16). The southern portion of Naphtali has been called the \u201cGarden of Palestine.\u201d It was of unrivalled fertility. It was the principal scene of our Lord\u2019s public ministry. Here most of his parables were spoken and his miracles wrought.\n\n This tribe was the first to suffer from the invasion of Benhadad, king of Syria, in the reigns of Baasha, king of Israel, and Asa, king of Judah ([1 Kings 15:20](/1kgs#1Kgs.15.20); [2 Chr. 16:4](/2chr#2Chr.16.4)). In the reign of Pekah, king of Israel, the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser swept over the whole north of Israel, and carried the people into captivity ([2 Kings 15:29](/2kgs#2Kgs.15.29)). Thus the kingdom of Israel came to an end (B.C. 722).\n\n Naphtali is now almost wholly a desert, the towns of Tiberias, on the shore of the Lake of Galilee, and Safed being the only places in it of any importance.",

It is so called because it contains a record of the numbering of the people in the wilderness of Sinai (1-4), and of their numbering afterwards on the plain of Moab (26).\n\n This book is of special historical interest as furnishing us with details as to the route of the Israelites in the wilderness and their principal encampments. It may be divided into three parts:\n\n 1. The numbering of the people at Sinai, and preparations for their resuming their march (1-10:10). The sixth chapter gives an account of the vow of a Nazarite.\n\n 2. An account of the journey from Sinai to Moab, the sending out of the spies and the report they brought back, and the murmurings (eight times) of the people at the hardships by the way (10:11-21:20).\n\n 3. The transactions in the plain of Moab before crossing the Jordan (21:21-ch. 36).\n\n The period comprehended in the history extends from the second month of the second year after the Exodus to the beginning of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, in all about thirty-eight years and ten months; a dreary period of wanderings, during which that disobedient generation all died in the wilderness. They were fewer in number at the end of their wanderings than when they left the land of Egypt. We see in this history, on the one hand, the unceasing care of the Almighty over his chosen people during their wanderings; and, on the other hand, the murmurings and rebellions by which they offended their heavenly Protector, drew down repeated marks of his displeasure, and provoked him to say that they should \u201cnot enter into his rest\u201d because of their unbelief ([Heb. 3:19](/heb#Heb.3.19)).\n\n This, like the other books of the Pentateuch, bears evidence of having been written by Moses.\n\n The expression \u201cthe book of the wars of the Lord,\u201d occurring in 21:14, has given rise to much discussion. But, after all, \u201cwhat this book was is uncertain, whether some writing of Israel not now extant, or some writing of the Amorites which contained songs and triumphs of their king Sihon\u2019s victories, out of which Moses may cite this testimony, as Paul sometimes does out of heathen poets ([Acts 17:28](/acts#Acts.17.28); [Titus 1:12](/titus#Titus.1.12)).\u201d",

Obadiah (1:11-14) speaks of this capture as a thing past. He sees the calamity as having already come on Jerusalem, and the Edomites as joining their forces with those of the Chaldeans in bringing about the degradation and ruin of Israel. We do not indeed read that the Edomites actually took part with the Chaldeans, but the probabilities are that they did so, and this explains the words of Obadiah in denouncing against Edom the judgments of God. The date of his prophecies was thus in or about the year of the destruction of Jerusalem.\n\n Edom is the type of Israel\u2019s and of God\u2019s last foe ([Isa. 63:1-4](/isa#Isa.63.1)).

It is first mentioned in connection with David\u2019s flight from Jerusalem through the rebellion of Absalom ([2 Sam. 15:30](/2sam#2Sam.15.30)), and is only once again mentioned in the Old Testament, in [Zech. 14:4](/zech#Zech.14.4). It is, however, frequently alluded to ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); [Neh. 8:15](/neh#Neh.8.15); [Ezek. 11:23](/ezek#Ezek.11.23)).\n\n It is frequently mentioned in the New Testament ([Matt. 21:1](/matt#Matt.21.1); [26:30](/matt#Matt.26.30), etc.). It now bears the name of Jebel et-Tur, i.e., \u201cMount of the Summit;\u201d also sometimes called Jebel ez-Zeitun, i.e., \u201cMount of Olives.\u201d It is about 200 feet above the level of the city. The road from Jerusalem to Bethany runs as of old over this mount. It was on this mount that Jesus stood when he wept over Jerusalem. \u201cNo name in Scripture,\u201d says Dr. Porter, \u201ccalls up associations at once so sacred and so pleasing as that of Olivet. The \u2018mount\u2019 is so intimately connected with the private, the devotional life of the Saviour, that we read of it and look at it with feelings of deepest interest and affection. Here he often sat with his disciples, telling them of wondrous events yet to come, of the destruction of the Holy City; of the sufferings, the persecution, and the final triumph of his followers ([Matt. 24](/matt#Matt.24)). Here he gave them the beautiful parables of the ten virgins and the five talents (25); here he was wont to retire on each evening for meditation, and prayer, and rest of body, when weary and harassed by the labours and trials of the day ([Luke 21:37](/luke#Luke.21.37)); and here he came on the night of his betrayal to utter that wonderful prayer, \u2018O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt\u2019 ([Matt. 26:39](/matt#Matt.26.39)). And when the cup of God\u2019s wrath had been drunk, and death and the grave conquered, he led his disciples out again over Olivet as far as to Bethany, and after a parting blessing ascended to heaven ([Luke 24:50](/luke#Luke.24.50), [51](/luke#Luke.24.51); [Acts 1:12](/acts#Acts.1.12)).\u201d\n\n This mount, or rather mountain range, has four summits or peaks: (1) the \u201cGalilee\u201d peak, so called from a tradition that the angels stood here when they spoke to the disciples ([Acts 1:11](/acts#Acts.1.11)); (2) the \u201cMount of Ascension,\u201d the supposed site of that event, which was, however, somewhere probably nearer Bethany ([Luke 24:51](/luke#Luke.24.51), [52](/luke#Luke.24.52)); (3) the \u201cProphets,\u201d from the catacombs on its side, called \u201cthe prophets\u2019 tombs;\u201d and (4) the \u201cMount of Corruption,\u201d so called because of the \u201chigh places\u201d erected there by Solomon for the idolatrous worship of his foreign wives ([1 Kings 11:7](/1kgs#1Kgs.11.7); [2 Kings 23:13](/2kgs#2Kgs.23.13); Vulg., \u201cMount of Offence\u201d).",

It appears to have been written shortly before the apostle\u2019s death (1:14). This epistle contains eleven references to the Old Testament. It also contains (3:15, 16) a remarkable reference to Paul\u2019s epistles. Some think this reference is to [1 Thess. 4:13-5:11](/1thess#1Thess.4.13). A few years ago, among other documents, a parchment fragment, called the \u201cGospel of Peter,\u201d was discovered in a Christian tomb at Akhmim in Upper Egypt. Origen (obiit A.D. 254), Eusebius (obiit 340), and Jerome (obiit 420) refer to such a work, and hence it has been concluded that it was probably written about the middle of the second century. It professes to give a history of our Lord\u2019s resurrection and ascension. While differing in not a few particulars from the canonical Gospels, the writer shows plainly that he was acquinted both with the synoptics and with the Gospel of John. Though apocryphal, it is of considerable value as showing that the main facts of the history of our Lord were then widely known.",

He throws off as far as possible his apostolic dignity and his fatherly authority over his converts. He speaks simply as Christian to Christian. He speaks, therefore, with that peculiar grace of humility and courtesy which has, under the reign of Christianity, developed the spirit of chivalry and what is called \u2018the character of a gentleman,\u2019 certainly very little known in the old Greek and Roman civilization\u201d (Dr. Barry).

            "dictText": "Was written by Paul during the two years when he was \u201cin bonds\u201d in Rome ([Phil. 1:7-13](/phil#Phil.1.7)), probably early in the year A.D. 62 or in the end of 61.\n\n The Philippians had sent Epaphroditus, their messenger, with contributions to meet the necessities of the apostle; and on his return Paul sent back with him this letter. With this precious communication Epaphroditus sets out on his homeward journey. \u201cThe joy caused by his return, and the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the church of Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost say that with this letter the church itself passes from our view. To-day, in silent meadows, quiet cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was once the flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most attractive church of the apostolic age. But the name and fame and spiritual influence of that church will never pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation the letter written in a dungeon at Rome, and carried along the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has been a light divine and a cheerful guide along the most rugged paths of life\u201d (Professor Beet).\n\n The church at Philippi was the first-fruits of European Christianity. Their attachment to the apostle was very fervent, and so also was his affection for them. They alone of all the churches helped him by their contributions, which he gratefully acknowledges ([Acts 20:33-35](/acts#Acts.20.33); [2 Cor. 11:7-12](/2cor#2Cor.11.7); [2 Thess. 3:8](/2thess#2Thess.3.8)). The pecuniary liberality of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously ([Phil. 4:15](/phil#Phil.4.15)). \u201cThis was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as [2 Cor. 8](/2cor#2Cor.8) and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor ([2 Cor. 8:2](/2cor#2Cor.8.2)); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious. At the present day the missionary liberality of poor Christians is, in proportion, really greater than that of the rich\u201d (Moule\u2019s Philippians, Introd.).\n\n The contents of this epistle give an interesting insight into the condition of the church at Rome at the time it was written. Paul\u2019s imprisonment, we are informed, was no hindrance to his preaching the gospel, but rather \u201cturned out to the furtherance of the gospel.\u201d The gospel spread very extensively among the Roman soldiers, with whom he was in constant contact, and the Christians grew into a \u201cvast multitude.\u201d It is plain that Christianity was at this time making rapid advancement in Rome.\n\n The doctrinal statements of this epistle bear a close relation to those of the Epistle to the Romans. Compare also [Phil. 3:20](/phil#Phil.3.20) with [Eph. 2:12](/eph#Eph.2.12), [19](/eph#Eph.2.19), where the church is presented under the idea of a city or commonwealth for the first time in Paul\u2019s writings. The personal glory of Christ is also set forth in almost parallel forms of expression in [Phil. 2:5-11](/phil#Phil.2.5), compared with [Eph. 1:17-23](/eph#Eph.1.17); [2:8](/eph#Eph.2.8); and [Col. 1:15-20](/col#Col.1.15). \u201cThis exposition of the grace and wonder of His personal majesty, personal self-abasement, and personal exaltation after it,\u201d found in these epistles, \u201cis, in a great measure, a new development in the revelations given through St. Paul\u201d (Moule). Other minuter analogies in forms of expression and of thought are also found in these epistles of the Captivity.",

            "dictText": "Probably connected with the Roman family of the Pontii, and called \u201cPilate\u201d from the Latin pileatus, i.e., \u201cwearing the pileus\u201d, which was the \u201ccap or badge of a manumitted slave,\u201d as indicating that he was a \u201cfreedman,\u201d or the descendant of one. He was the sixth in the order of the Roman procurators of Judea (A.D. 26-36). His headquarters were at Caesarea, but he frequently went up to Jerusalem. His reign extended over the period of the ministry of John the Baptist and of Jesus Christ, in connection with whose trial his name comes into prominent notice. Pilate was a \u201ctypical Roman, not of the antique, simple stamp, but of the imperial period, a man not without some remains of the ancient Roman justice in his soul, yet pleasure-loving, imperious, and corrupt. He hated the Jews whom he ruled, and in times of irritation freely shed their blood. They returned his hatred with cordiality, and accused him of every crime, maladministration, cruelty, and robbery. He visited Jerusalem as seldom as possible; for, indeed, to one accustomed to the pleasures of Rome, with its theatres, baths, games, and gay society, Jerusalem, with its religiousness and ever-smouldering revolt, was a dreary residence. When he did visit it he stayed in the palace of Herod the Great, it being common for the officers sent by Rome into conquered countries to occupy the palaces of the displaced sovereigns.\u201d\n\n After his trial before the Sanhedrin, Jesus was brought to the Roman procurator, Pilate, who had come up to Jerusalem as usual to preserve order during the Passover, and was now residing, perhaps, in the castle of Antonia, or it may be in Herod\u2019s palace. Pilate came forth from his palace and met the deputation from the Sanhedrin, who, in answer to his inquiry as to the nature of the accusation they had to prefer against Jesus, accused him of being a \u201cmalefactor.\u201d Pilate was not satisfied with this, and they further accused him (1) of sedition, (2) preventing the payment of the tribute to Caesar, and (3) of assuming the title of king ([Luke 23:2](/luke#Luke.23.2)). Pilate now withdrew with Jesus into the palace ([John 18:33](/john#John.18.33)) and examined him in private (37, 38); and then going out to the deputation still standing before the gate, he declared that he could find no fault in Jesus ([Luke 23:4](/luke#Luke.23.4)). This only aroused them to more furious clamour, and they cried that he excited the populace \u201cthroughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee.\u201d When Pilate heard of Galilee, he sent the accused to Herod Antipas, who had jurisdiction over that province, thus hoping to escape the difficulty in which he found himself. But Herod, with his men of war, set Jesus at nought, and sent him back again to Pilate, clad in a purple robe of mockery (23:11, 12).\n\n Pilate now proposed that as he and Herod had found no fault in him, they should release Jesus; and anticipating that they would consent to this proposal, he ascended the judgment-seat as if ready to ratify the decision ([Matt. 27:19](/matt#Matt.27.19)). But at this moment his wife (Claudia Procula) sent a message to him imploring him to have nothing to do with the \u201cjust person.\u201d Pilate\u2019s feelings of perplexity and awe were deepened by this incident, while the crowd vehemently cried out, \u201cNot this man, but Barabbas.\u201d Pilate answered, \u201cWhat then shall I do with Jesus?\u201d The fierce cry immediately followed. \u201cLet him be crucified.\u201d Pilate, apparently vexed, and not knowning what to do, said, \u201cWhy, what evil hath he done?\u201d but with yet fiercer fanaticism the crowd yelled out, \u201cAway with him! crucify him, crucify him!\u201d Pilate yielded, and sent Jesus away to be scourged. This scourging was usually inflicted by lictors; but as Pilate was only a procurator he had no lictor, and hence his soldiers inflicted this terrible punishment. This done, the soldiers began to deride the sufferer, and they threw around him a purple robe, probably some old cast-off robe of state ([Matt. 27:28](/matt#Matt.27.28); [John 19:2](/john#John.19.2)), and putting a reed in his right hand, and a crowd of thorns on his head, bowed the knee before him in mockery, and saluted him, saying, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d They took also the reed and smote him with it on the head and face, and spat in his face, heaping upon him every indignity.\n\n Pilate then led forth Jesus from within the Praetorium ([Matt. 27:27](/matt#Matt.27.27)) before the people, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, saying, \u201cBehold the man!\u201d But the sight of Jesus, now scourged and crowned and bleeding, only stirred their hatred the more, and again they cried out, \u201cCrucify him, crucify him!\u201d and brought forth this additional charge against him, that he professed to be \u201cthe Son of God.\u201d Pilate heard this accusation with a superstitious awe, and taking him once more within the Praetorium, asked him, \u201cWhence art thou?\u201d Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate was irritated by his continued silence, and said, \u201cKnowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee?\u201d Jesus, with calm dignity, answered the Roman, \u201cThou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above.\u201d\n\n After this Pilate seemed more resolved than ever to let Jesus go. The crowd perceiving this cried out, \u201cIf thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar\u2019s friend.\u201d This settled the matter. He was afraid of being accused to the emperor. Calling for water, he washed his hands in the sight of the people, saying, \u201cI am innocent of the blood of this just person.\u201d The mob, again scorning his scruples, cried, \u201cHis blood be on us, and on our children.\u201d Pilate was stung to the heart by their insults, and putting forth Jesus before them, said, \u201cShall I crucify your King?\u201d The fatal moment had now come. They madly exclaimed, \u201cWe have no king but Caesar;\u201d and now Jesus is given up to them, and led away to be crucified.\n\n By the direction of Pilate an inscription was placed, according to the Roman custom, over the cross, stating the crime for which he was crucified. Having ascertained from the centurion that he was dead, he gave up the body to Joseph of Arimathea to be buried. Pilate\u2019s name now disappears from the Gospel history. References to him, however, are found in the Acts of the Apostles (3:13; 4:27; 13:28), and in [1 Tim. 6:13](/1tim#1Tim.6.13). In A.D. 36 the governor of Syria brought serious accusations against Pilate, and he was banished to Vienne in Gaul, where, according to tradition, he committed suicide.",

This tribe united with that of Gad in asking permission to settle in the \u201cland of Gilead,\u201d \u201con the other side of Jordan\u201d (32:1-5). The lot assigned to Reuben was the smallest of the lots given to the trans-Jordanic tribes.

His name occurs four times in the book itself (1:1, 4, 9; 22:8), and there is every reason to conclude that the \u201cJohn\u201d here mentioned was the apostle. In a manuscript of about the twelfth century he is called \u201cJohn the divine,\u201d but no reason can be assigned for this appellation.\n\n The date of the writing of this book has generally been fixed at A.D. 96, in the reign of Domitian. There are some, however, who contend for an earlier date, A.D. 68 or 69, in the reign of Nero. Those who are in favour of the later date appeal to the testimony of the Christian father Irenaeus, who received information relative to this book from those who had seen John face to face. He says that the Apocalypse \u201cwas seen no long time ago.\u201d\n\n As to the relation between this book and the Gospel of John, it has been well observed that \u201cthe leading ideas of both are the same. The one gives us in a magnificent vision, the other in a great historic drama, the supreme conflict between good and evil and its issue. In both Jesus Christ is the central figure, whose victory through defeat is the issue of the conflict. In both the Jewish dispensation is the preparation for the gospel, and the warfare and triumph of the Christ is described in language saturated with the Old Testament. The difference of date will go a long way toward explaining the difference of style.\u201d Plummer\u2019s Gospel of St. John, Introd.",

            "dictText": "This epistle was probably written at Corinth. Phoebe ([Rom. 16:1](/rom#Rom.16.1)) of Cenchrea conveyed it to Rome, and Gaius of Corinth entertained the apostle at the time of his writing it (16:23; [1 Cor. 1:14](/1cor#1Cor.1.14)), and Erastus was chamberlain of the city, i.e., of Corinth ([2 Tim. 4:20](/2tim#2Tim.4.20)).\n\n The precise time at which it was written is not mentioned in the epistle, but it was obviously written when the apostle was about to \u201cgo unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints\u201d, i.e., at the close of his second visit to Greece, during the winter preceding his last visit to that city ([Rom. 15:25](/rom#Rom.15.25); comp. [Acts 19:21](/acts#Acts.19.21); [20:2](/acts#Acts.20.2), [3](/acts#Acts.20.3), [16](/acts#Acts.20.16); [1 Cor. 16:1-4](/1cor#1Cor.16.1)), early in A.D. 58.\n\n It is highly probable that Christianity was planted in Rome by some of those who had been at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost ([Acts 2:10](/acts#Acts.2.10)). At this time the Jews were very numerous in Rome, and their synagogues were probably resorted to by Romans also, who in this way became acquainted with the great facts regarding Jesus as these were reported among the Jews. Thus a church composed of both Jews and Gentiles was formed at Rome. Many of the brethren went out to meet Paul on his approach to Rome. There are evidences that Christians were then in Rome in considerable numbers, and had probably more than one place of meeting ([Rom. 16:14](/rom#Rom.16.14), [15](/rom#Rom.16.15)).\n\n The object of the apostle in writing to this church was to explain to them the great doctrines of the gospel. His epistle was a \u201cword in season.\u201d Himself deeply impressed with a sense of the value of the doctrines of salvation, he opens up in a clear and connected form the whole system of the gospel in its relation both to Jew and Gentile. This epistle is peculiar in this, that it is a systematic exposition of the gospel of universal application. The subject is here treated argumentatively, and is a plea for Gentiles addressed to Jews. In the Epistle to the Galatians, the same subject is discussed, but there the apostle pleads his own authority, because the church in Galatia had been founded by him.\n\n After the introduction (1:1-15), the apostle presents in it divers aspects and relations the doctrine of justification by faith (1:16-11:36) on the ground of the imputed righteousness of Christ. He shows that salvation is all of grace, and only of grace. This main section of his letter is followed by various practical exhortations (12:1-15:13), which are followed by a conclusion containing personal explanations and salutations, which contain the names of twenty-four Christians at Rome, a benediction, and a doxology ([Rom. 15:14](/rom#Rom.15.14)-ch. 16).",

Samuel penned the first twenty-four chapters of the first book. Gad, the companion of David ([1 Sam. 22:5](/1sam#1Sam.22.5)), continued the history thus commenced; and Nathan completed it, probably arranging the whole in the form in which we now have it ([1 Chr. 29:29](/1chr#1Chr.29.29)).\n\n The contents of the books. The first book comprises a period of about a hundred years, and nearly coincides with the life of Samuel. It contains (1) the history of Eli (1-4); (2) the history of Samuel (5-12); (3) the history of Saul, and of David in exile (13-31). The second book, comprising a period of perhaps fifty years, contains a history of the reign of David (1) over Judah (1-4), and (2) over all Israel (5-24), mainly in its political aspects. The last four chapters of Second Samuel may be regarded as a sort of appendix recording various events, but not chronologically. These books do not contain complete histories. Frequent gaps are met with in the record, because their object is to present a history of the kingdom of God in its gradual development, and not of the events of the reigns of the successive rulers. It is noticeable that the section ([2 Sam. 11:2-12](/2sam#2Sam.11.2): 29) containing an account of David\u2019s sin in the matter of Bathsheba is omitted in the corresponding passage in [1 Chr. 20](/1chr#1Chr.20).",

It has been identified with the Birket Silwan in the lower Tyropoeon valley, to the south-east of the hill of Zion.\n\n The water which flows into this pool intermittingly by a subterranean channel springs from the \u201cFountain of the Virgin\u201d (q.v.). The length of this channel, which has several windings, is 1,750 feet, though the direct distance is only 1,100 feet. The pool is 53 feet in length from north to south, 18 feet wide, and 19 deep. The water passes from it by a channel cut in the rock into the gardens below. (See EN-ROGEL.)\n\n Many years ago (1880) a youth, while wading up the conduit by which the water enters the pool, accidentally discovered an inscription cut in the rock, on the eastern side, about 19 feet from the pool. This is the oldest extant Hebrew record of the kind. It has with great care been deciphered by scholars, and has been found to be an account of the manner in which the tunnel was constructed. Its whole length is said to be \u201ctwelve hundred cubits;\u201d and the inscription further notes that the workmen, like the excavators of the Mont Cenis Tunnel, excavated from both ends, meeting in the middle.\n\n Some have argued that the inscription was cut in the time of Solomon; others, with more probability, refer it to the reign of Hezekiah. A more ancient tunnel was discovered in 1889 some 20 feet below the ground. It is of smaller dimensions, but more direct in its course. It is to this tunnel that Isaiah (8:6) probably refers.\n\n The Siloam inscription above referred to was surreptitiously cut from the wall of the tunnel in 1891 and broken into fragments. These were, however, recovered by the efforts of the British Consul at Jerusalem, and have been restored to their original place.",

It appears that at some remote period a colony from the capital of king Mesha (Dibon-Moab) crossed the Jordan and fixed itself at the gates of Jerusalem at Silwan.

It was celebrated immediately after the harvest, in the month Tisri, and the celebration lasted for eight days ([Lev. 23:33-43](/lev#Lev.23.33)). During that period the people left their homes and lived in booths formed of the branches of trees. The sacrifices offered at this time are mentioned in [Num. 29:13-38](/num#Num.29.13). It was at the time of this feast that Solomon\u2019s temple was dedicated ([1 Kings 8:2](/1kgs#1Kgs.8.2)). Mention is made of it after the return from the Captivity. This feast was designed (1) to be a memorial of the wilderness wanderings, when the people dwelt in booths ([Lev. 23:43](/lev#Lev.23.43)), and (2) to be a harvest thanksgiving ([Neh. 8:9-18](/neh#Neh.8.9)). The Jews, at a later time, introduced two appendages to the original festival, viz., (1) that of drawing water from the Pool of Siloam, and pouring it upon the altar ([John 7:2](/john#John.7.2), [37](/john#John.7.37)), as a memorial of the water from the rock in Horeb; and (2) of lighting the lamps at night, a memorial of the pillar of fire by night during their wanderings.\n\n \u201cThe feast of Tabernacles, the harvest festival of the Jewish Church, was the most popular and important festival after the Captivity. At Jerusalem it was a gala day. It was to the autumn pilgrims, who arrived on the 14th (of the month Tisri, the feast beginning on the 15th) day, like entrance into a silvan city. Roofs and courtyards, streets and squares, roads and gardens, were green with boughs of citron and myrtle, palm and willow. The booths recalled the pilgrimage through the wilderness.

The building had suffered considerably from natural decay as well as from the assaults of hostile armies, and Herod, desirous of gaining the favour of the Jews, proposed to rebuild it. This offer was accepted, and the work was begun (B.C. 18), and carried out at great labour and expense, and on a scale of surpassing splendour. The main part of the building was completed in ten years, but the erection of the outer courts and the embellishment of the whole were carried on during the entire period of our Lord\u2019s life on earth ([John 2:16](/john#John.2.16), [19-21](/john#John.2.19)), and the temple was completed only A.D. 65. But it was not long permitted to exist. Within forty years after our Lord\u2019s crucifixion, his prediction of its overthrow was accomplished ([Luke 19](/luke#Luke.19): 41-44). The Roman legions took the city of Jerusalem by storm, and notwithstanding the strenuous efforts Titus made to preserve the temple, his soldiers set fire to it in several places, and it was utterly destroyed (A.D. 70), and was never rebuilt.\n\n Several remains of Herod\u2019s stately temple have by recent explorations been brought to light. It had two courts, one intended for the Israelites only, and the other, a large outer court, called \u201cthe court of the Gentiles,\u201d intended for the use of strangers of all nations. These two courts were separated by a low wall, as Josephus states, some 4 1/2 feet high, with thirteen openings. Along the top of this dividing wall, at regular intervals, were placed pillars bearing in Greek an inscription to the effect that no stranger was, on the pain of death, to pass from the court of the Gentiles into that of the Jews. At the entrance to a graveyard at the north-western angle of the Haram wall, a stone was discovered by M. Ganneau in 1871, built into the wall, bearing the following inscription in Greek capitals: \u201cNo stranger is to enter within the partition wall and enclosure around the sanctuary. Whoever is caught will be responsible to himself for his death, which will ensue.\u201d\n\n There can be no doubt that the stone thus discovered was one of those originally placed on the boundary wall which separated the Jews from the Gentiles, of which Josephus speaks.\n\n It is of importance to notice that the word rendered \u201csanctuary\u201d in the inscription was used in a specific sense of the inner court, the court of the Israelites, and is the word rendered \u201ctemple\u201d in [John 2:15](/john#John.2.15) and [Acts 21:28](/acts#Acts.21.28), [29](/acts#Acts.21.29). When Paul speaks of the middle wall of partition ([Eph. 2:14](/eph#Eph.2.14)), he probably makes allusion to this dividing wall. Within this partition wall stood the temple proper, consisting of, (1) the court of the women, 8 feet higher than the outer court; (2) 10 feet higher than this court was the court of Israel; (3) the court of the priests, again 3 feet higher; and lastly (4) the temple floor, 8 feet above that; thus in all 29 feet above the level of the outer court.\n\n The summit of Mount Moriah, on which the temple stood, is now occupied by the Haram esh-Sherif, i.e., \u201cthe sacred enclosure.\u201d This enclosure is about 1,500 feet from north to south, with a breadth of about 1,000 feet, covering in all a space of about 35 acres. About the centre of the enclosure is a raised platform, 16 feet above the surrounding space, and paved with large stone slabs, on which stands the Mohammedan mosque called Kubbet es-Sahkra i.e., the \u201cDome of the Rock,\u201d or the Mosque of Omar. This mosque covers the site of Solomon\u2019s temple. In the centre of the dome there is a bare, projecting rock, the highest part of Moriah (q.v.), measuring 60 feet by 40, standing 6 feet above the floor of the mosque, called the sahkra, i.e., \u201crock.\u201d Over this rock the altar of burnt-offerings stood. It was the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. The exact position on this \u201csacred enclosure\u201d which the temple occupied has not been yet definitely ascertained. Some affirm that Herod\u2019s temple covered the site of Solomon\u2019s temple and palace, and in addition enclosed a square of 300 feet at the south-western angle. The temple courts thus are supposed to have occupied the southern portion of the \u201cenclosure,\u201d forming in all a square of more than 900 feet. It is argued by others that Herod\u2019s temple occupied a square of 600 feet at the south-west of the \u201cenclosure.\u201d",

            "dictText": "Before his death David had \u201cwith all his might\u201d provided materials in great abundance for the building of the temple on the summit of Mount Moriah ([1 Chr. 22:14](/1chr#1Chr.22.14); [29:4](/1chr#1Chr.29.4); [2 Chr. 3:1](/2chr#2Chr.3.1)), on the east of the city, on the spot where Abraham had offered up Isaac ([Gen. 22:1-14](/gen#Gen.22.1)). In the beginning of his reign Solomon set about giving effect to the desire that had been so earnestly cherished by his father, and prepared additional materials for the building. From subterranean quarries at Jerusalem he obtained huge blocks of stone for the foundations and walls of the temple. These stones were prepared for their places in the building under the eye of Tyrian master-builders. He also entered into a compact with Hiram II., king of Tyre, for the supply of whatever else was needed for the work, particularly timber from the forests of Lebanon, which was brought in great rafts by the sea to Joppa, whence it was dragged to Jerusalem ([1 Kings 5](/1kgs#1Kgs.5)). As the hill on which the temple was to be built did not afford sufficient level space, a huge wall of solid masonry of great height, in some places more than 200 feet high, was raised across the south of the hill, and a similar wall on the eastern side, and in the spaces between were erected many arches and pillars, thus raising up the general surface to the required level. Solomon also provided for a sufficient water supply for the temple by hewing in the rocky hill vast cisterns, into which water was conveyed by channels from the \u201cpools\u201d near Bethlehem. One of these cisterns, the \u201cgreat sea,\u201d was capable of containing three millions of gallons. The overflow was led off by a conduit to the Kidron.\n\n In all these preparatory undertakings a space of about three years was occupied; and now the process of the erection of the great building began, under the direction of skilled Phoenician builders and workmen, in the fourth year of Solomon\u2019s reign, 480 years after the Exodus ([1 Kings 6](/1kgs#1Kgs.6); [2 Chr. 3](/2chr#2Chr.3)). Many thousands of labourers and skilled artisans were employed in the work. Stones prepared in the quarries underneath the city ([1 Kings 5:17](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.17), [18](/1kgs#1Kgs.5.18)) of huge dimension (see QUARRIES) were gradually placed on the massive walls, and closely fitted together without any mortar between, till the whole structure was completed. No sound of hammer or axe or any tool of iron was heard as the structure arose (6:7). \u201cLike some tall palm the noiseless fabric sprang.\u201d The building was 60 cubits long, 20 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high. The engineers of the Palestine Exploration Fund, in their explorations around the temple area, discovered what is believed to have been the \u201cchief corner stone\u201d of the temple, \u201cthe most interesting stone in the world.\u201d It lies at the bottom of the south-eastern angle, and is 3 feet 8 inches high by 14 feet long. It rests on the solid rock at a depth of 79 feet 3 inches below the present surface. (See PINNACLE.) In examining the walls the engineers were \u201cstruck with admiration at the vastness of the blocks and the general excellence of the workmanship.\u201d\n\n At length, in the autumn of the eleventh year of his reign, seven and a half years after it had been begun, the temple was completed in all its architectural magnificence and beauty. For thirteen years there it stood, on the summit of Moriah, silent and unused. The reasons for this strange delay in its consecration are unknown. At the close of these thirteen years preparations for the dedication of the temple were made on a scale of the greatest magnificence. The ark was solemnly brought from the tent in which David had deposited it to the place prepared for it in the temple, and the glory-cloud, the symbol of the divine presence, filled the house. Then Solomon ascended a platform which had been erected for him, in the sight of all the people, and lifting up his hands to heaven poured out his heart to God in prayer ([1 Kings 8](/1kgs#1Kgs.8); [2 Chr. 6](/2chr#2Chr.6), [7](/2chr#2Chr.7)). The feast of dedication, which lasted seven days, followed by the feast of tabernacles, marked a new era in the history of Israel. On the eighth day of the feast of tabernacles, Solomon dismissed the vast assemblage of the people, who returned to their homes filled with joy and gladness, \u201cHad Solomon done no other service beyond the building of the temple, he would still have influenced the religious life of his people down to the latest days. It was to them a perpetual reminder and visible symbol of God\u2019s presence and protection, a strong bulwark of all the sacred traditions of the law, a witness to duty, an impulse to historic study, an inspiration of sacred song.\u201d\n\n The temple consisted of,",

            "dictText": "After the return from captivity, under Zerubbabel (q.v.) and the high priest Jeshua, arrangements were almost immediately made to reorganize the long-desolated kingdom. The body of pilgrims, forming a band of 42,360, including children, having completed the long and dreary journey of some four months, from the banks of the Euphrates to Jerusalem, were animated in all their proceeding by a strong religious impulse, and therefore one of their first cares was to restore their ancient worship by rebuilding the temple. On the invitation of Zerubbabel, the governor, who showed them a remarkable example of liberality by contributing personally 1,000 golden darics (probably about $6,000), besides other gifts, the people with great enthusiasm poured their gifts into the sacred treasury ([Ezra 2](/ezra#Ezra.2)). First they erected and dedicated the altar of Jehovah on the exact spot where it had formerly stood, and they then cleared away the charred heaps of debris which occupied the site of the old temple; and in the second month of the second year (B.C. 535), amid great public excitement and rejoicing ([Ps. 116](/ps#Ps.116); [117](/ps#Ps.117); [118](/ps#Ps.118)), the foundations of the second temple were laid. A wide interest was felt in this great movement, although it was regarded with mingled feelings by the spectators ([Hag. 2:3](/hag#Hag.2.3); [Zech. 4:10](/zech#Zech.4.10)). The Samaritans made proposals for a co-operation in the work. Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the elders, however, declined all such cooperation: Judah must build the temple without help. Immediately evil reports were spread regarding the Jews. The Samaritans sought to \u201cfrustrate their purpose\u201d ([Ezra 4:5](/ezra#Ezra.4.5)), and sent messengers to Ecbatana and Susa, with the result that the work was suspended. Seven years after this Cyrus died ingloriously, having killed himself in Syria when on his way back from Egypt to the east, and was succeeded by his son Cambyses (B.C. 529-522), on whose death the \u201cfalse Smerdis,\u201d an imposter, occupied the throne for some seven or eight months, and then Darius Hystaspes became king (B.C. 522). In the second year of this monarch the work of rebuilding the temple was resumed and carried forward to its completion ([Ezra 5](/ezra#Ezra.5): 6-17; 6:1-15), under the stimulus of the earnest counsels and admonitions of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah. It was ready for consecration in the spring of B.C. 516, twenty years after the return from captivity.\n\n This second temple had not the ark, the Urim and Thummim, the holy oil, the sacred fire, the tables of stone, the pot of manna, and Aaron\u2019s rod. As in the tabernacle, there was in it only one golden lamp for the holy place, one table of shewbread, and the incense altar, with golden censers, and many of the vessels of gold that had belonged to Solomon\u2019s temple that had been carried to Babylon but restored by Cyrus ([Ezra 1:7-11](/ezra#Ezra.1.7)).\n\n This second temple also differed from the first in that, while in the latter there were numerous \u201ctrees planted in the courts of the Lord,\u201d there were none in the former. The second temple also had for the first time a space, being a part of the outer court, provided for proselytes who were worshippers of Jehovah, although not subject to the laws of Judaism.\n\n The temple, when completed, was consecrated amid great rejoicings on the part of all the people ([Ezra 6:16](/ezra#Ezra.6.16)), although there were not wanting outward evidences that the Jews were no longer an independent people, but were subject to a foreign power.\n\n [Hag. 2:9](/hag#Hag.2.9) is rightly rendered in the Revised Version, \u201cThe latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former,\u201d instead of, \u201cThe glory of this latter house,\u201d etc., in the Authorized Version. The temple, during the different periods of its existence, is regarded as but one house, the one only house of God (comp. 2:3). The glory here predicted is spiritual glory and not material splendour. \u201cChrist himself, present bodily in the temple on Mount Zion during his life on earth, present spiritually in the Church now, present in the holy city, the heavenly Jerusalem, of which he is the temple, calling forth spiritual worship and devotion is the glory here predicted\u201d (Perowne).",

It was in all probability written from Corinth, where he abode a \u201clong time\u201d ([Acts 18:11](/acts#Acts.18.11), [18](/acts#Acts.18.18)), early in the period of his residence there, about the end of A.D. 52.\n\n The occasion of its being written was the return of Timotheus from Macedonia, bearing tidings from Thessalonica regarding the state of the church there ([Acts 18:1-5](/acts#Acts.18.1); [1 Thess. 3:6](/1thess#1Thess.3.6)). While, on the whole, the report of Timothy was encouraging, it also showed that divers errors and misunderstandings regarding the tenor of Paul\u2019s teaching had crept in amongst them. He addresses them in this letter with the view of correcting these errors, and especially for the purpose of exhorting them to purity of life, reminding them that their sanctification was the great end desired by God regarding them.\n\n The subscription erroneously states that this epistle was written from Athens.\n\n The second epistle to the Thessalonians was probably also written from Corinth, and not many months after the first.\n\n The occasion of the writing of this epistle was the arrival of tidings that the tenor of the first epistle had been misunderstood, especially with reference to the second advent of Christ. The Thessalonians had embraced the idea that Paul had taught that \u201cthe day of Christ was at hand\u201d, that Christ\u2019s coming was just about to happen. This error is corrected (2:1-12), and the apostle prophetically announces what first must take place. \u201cThe apostasy\u201d was first to arise. Various explanations of this expression have been given, but that which is most satisfactory refers it to the Church of Rome.",

Both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church; and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same. Timothy and Titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions, and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies. This affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters, which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike, but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions. The writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation, and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition (comp. [1 Tim. 1:2](/1tim#1Tim.1.2), [3](/1tim#1Tim.1.3) with [Titus 1:4](/titus#Titus.1.4), [5](/titus#Titus.1.5); [1 Tim. 1:4](/1tim#1Tim.1.4) with [Titus 1:13](/titus#Titus.1.13), [14](/titus#Titus.1.14); 3:9; [1 Tim. 4:12](/1tim#1Tim.4.12) with [Titus 2:7](/titus#Titus.2.7), [15](/titus#Titus.2.15)).\u201d, Paley\u2019s Horae Paulinae.\n\n The date of its composition may be concluded from the circumstance that it was written after Paul\u2019s visit to Crete ([Titus 1:5](/titus#Titus.1.5)).

We may warrantably suppose that after his release Paul sailed from Rome into Asia and took Crete by the way, and that there he left Titus \u201cto set in order the things that were wanting.\u201d Thence he went to Ephesus, where he left Timothy, and from Ephesus to Macedonia, where he wrote First Timothy, and thence to Nicopolis in Epirus, from which place he wrote to Titus, about A.D. 66 or 67.\n\n In the subscription to the epistle it is said to have been written from \u201cNicopolis of Macedonia,\u201d but no such place is known.

They say if men are not saved by works, then works are not necessary. If the most moral of men are saved in the same way as the very chief of sinners, then good works are of no moment. And more than this, if the grace of God is most clearly displayed in the salvation of the vilest of men, then the worse men are the better.\n\n The objection has no validity. The gospel of salvation by grace shows that good works are necessary. It is true, unchangeably true, that without holiness no man shall see the Lord. \u201cNeither adulterers, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards\u201d shall inherit the kingdom of God.\n\n Works are \u201cgood\u201d only when, (1) they spring from the principle of love to God. The moral character of an act is determined by the moral principle that prompts it. Faith and love in the heart are the essential elements of all true obedience.
